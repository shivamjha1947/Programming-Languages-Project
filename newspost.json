      "\nShares of Alphabet rose 2% on Wednesday, with some investors saying Pichai\u2019s pragmatic approach and his background at Alphabet\u2019s core business may make him less patient about money-losing projects fostered in recent years by Larry Page and Sergey Brin\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Alphabet\u2019s leadership change has some investors hoping that the owner of Google will take a hard look at the cash-burning ventures championed by its founders.Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced on Tuesday they were stepping aside as executives of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, with trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, taking the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet.Shares of Alphabet rose 2% on Wednesday, with some investors saying Pichai\u2019s pragmatic approach and his background at Alphabet\u2019s core business may make him less patient about money-losing projects fostered in recent years by Page and Brin. One of the biggest changes for Pichai will be taking responsibility for those so-called \u201cmoonshots,\u201d which are aimed at diversifying Alphabet\u2019s business.Alphabet has put in billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.\u201cThe question is, will they continue to spend money on these other bets? Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100 million. \u201cThat would add an extra excitement about the stock.\u201dAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets division, which includes those ventures, had an operating loss of $3.4 billion last year, compared to a $36.5 billion operating profit delivered by Google. Pichai now faces the challenge of balancing the potential benefit of bold, uncertain bets about future technology with their short-term costs.Investments in Other Bets have already been cut over the last two years, as Alphabet pushes more money into Google\u2019s cloud computing and consumer hardware businesses. Pichai could continue that trend.\u201cI don\u2019t think this means they\u2019re going to discard their other bets. I think they'll continue to explore other potential business opportunities, but those may be under greater scrutiny,\u201d said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC, which holds shares of Alphabet on behalf of its clients.Page and Brin, both 46, will remain directors of the parent company and still control it through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26% of Alphabet\u2019s total voting power, Brin 25% and Pichai less than 1%.King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said he expected decisions to be made faster under Pichai, who has spent 15 years at Google and rose to prominence while leading the development of Google\u2019s Chrome browser.\u201cHe can execute more effectively without having to worry about stepping on the toes of Page and Brin,\u201d Lip said.The company\u2019s stock has risen 70% since Pichai became CEO of Google, which accounts for close to 99% of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

FTC and Amazon declined to comment on the report.In cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing areas in the technology industry, businesses rent out servers from Amazon instead of running their own data centers.Amazon is the biggest cloud services provider, competing most closely with Microsoft Corp. Smaller companies also compete to provide services on cloud networks to developers and corporate customers.Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s cloud unit to generate $34.9 billion in sales in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.In addition to the FTC probes, the Justice Department and House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are investigating all four big tech companies.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nUntil now, Instagram except for limited circumstances has required its 1 billion users only to say they are at least 13 years old\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram said it will require birthdates from all new users starting on Wednesday, expanding the audience for ads for alcohol and other age-restricted products while offering new safety measures for younger users.Until now, Instagram, except for limited circumstances, has required its 1 billion users only to say they are at least 13 years old.Instagram said advertisers were not the driving force for the new requirement. Gambling and birth control are among other types of ads restricted to older audiences by Instagram policies and laws.The policy change could help stave off passage of costly child safety and data privacy regulations as lawmakers and family safety groups in the United States, Britain and elsewhere criticize the app for exposing children to inappropriate material.The birthdate requirement is the latest step Instagram has taken to move away from longstanding principles such as anonymity that had distinguished it from Facebook\u2019s namesake app.\u201cUnderstanding how old people are is quite important to the work we're doing, not only to create age-appropriate experiences but to live up to our longstanding rule to not allow access to young people,\u201d Instagram's head of product Vishal Shah said in an interview with Reuters.He declined to specify age-based features in testing, but said age could be the basis for recommended privacy settings or in-app education about staying safe online. Birthdates will not be visible to other users.In addition, Instagram will introduce in the coming weeks options for users to block messages from people they do not follow and for both businesses and popular users who are known as \u201ccreators\u201d to more easily restrict minors from viewing their posts, Shah said.Scrutiny of Instagram increased as it overtook Facebook\u2019s main app in popularity among teens and young adults and became a leading contributor to Facebook\u2019s revenue growth.Instagram will not verify birthdates because teens often cannot prove their age, and it will still be left without birthdays of some existing users. Instagram expects most people will be honest about birthdates and said artificial intelligence could eventually aid verification.Jeffrey Chester, who focuses on kids\u2019 safety issues at the Washington-based Centre for Digital Democracy, described Instagram\u2019s new policy as \u201clong overdue\u201d to come in step with U.S. laws aimed at preserving the online privacy of children under 13.But the London-based National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said asking for \u201can unverifiable date of birth will do nothing in practice to protect children from harmful or age-inappropriate content.\u201dUntil now, Instagram required birthdates only in limited circumstances.Users who had merged their Instagram profile and Facebook account, which requires a birthdate to create, turned over the data. Minors in the European Union over the last 18 months also had to submit birthdates so the company could comply with the region\u2019s new data privacy law, known commonly as GDPR.The existing birthdays, along with some rough analysis by workers poring over posts mentioning \u201chappy birthday\u201d and other terms, has helped Instagram train machine learning software that predicts a user\u2019s age and gender.The automated prediction also takes into account the variety of posts someone makes and the hashtags used.Instagram employs its predictions to understand usage patterns by age and gender. But Shah said Instagram is reluctant to use predictions to personalise features or determine whether someone is lying about their age because of reliability and transparency concerns. The forthcoming birthdate data will help improve accuracy, Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to use people\u2019s explicit (birthdate) input for now, but that might change,\u201d he said.Current users who have not linked their Instagram and Facebook accounts will be able to add their birthdates starting Wednesday, but the company is still debating whether it would be too intrusive to make it mandatory, Shah said. Instagram knows whether some of those users are adults, for instance, because it asks them to say so before looking at profiles of alcohol and sexually explicit businesses.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has announced radar imaging satellite RISAT-2BR1 as its next launch this month.The 24-hour all-weather earth imaging satellite will be sent to orbit along with nine small customer satellites on December 11 at 3.25 p.m. IST from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota subject to weather conditions, a statement said on Wednesday.The mission comes up just two weeks after Cartosat-3, which was orbited on November 27 from the SDSC.The upcoming primary satellite weighing 628 kg will be flown on the PSLV-C48. It will be placed in an orbit of 576 km and an inclination of 37 degrees.Its co-passengers are six satellites of a U.S. customer and one each of operators from Israel, Italy and Japan, which signed separate launch contracts with the ISRO\u2019s new company NewSpace India Ltd.A RISAT\u2019s uses are in identification of objects on ground, agriculture, mining, forestry, soil moisture, monitoring of the coast and sea ice and flood monitoring. It is useful in military surveillance.The ISRO said this would be the 50th mission of the PSLV, which has been in service since the mid-1990s. It would fly for the second time in the recently introduced \u2018QL\u2019 configuration that includes four strap-on motors.For the SDSC, it would be the 75th launch vehicle mission and the 37th flight from the older first launch pad.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA creative of one of AudioHop\u2019s popular podcasts in collaboration with Fittr\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n A new Pune-based content start-up, called AudioHop is focusing solely on podcasts. Founder Piyush Shinde, 30, who has been at this now for eight months, claims that his venture is only the second \u201cpremium podcast network\u201d in India after IVM Podcasts of Indus Vox Media, which was founded by Amit Doshi.\u201cThe reason I believe in audio is that there\u2019s huge market [in India], but there\u2019s [not enough quality] content,\u201d Shinde says, adding that \u201ca lot of people create podcasts because they think its easy \u2014 that\u2019s a myth.\u201d AudioHop already has four shows ongoing. This includes one in partnership with Fittr, an online health community, on food histories and our contemporary relationship with items like cheese, potatoes, almond, and soya. The host for this show is fitness entrepreneur Jitendra Chouksey, founder of SQUATS (Systematic Quantitative Unified Aesthetic Training System. Another such featured podcast is in collaboration with columnist Sudha Menon. Called Fabulous at Fifty, it is a spin off from her 2018 book, Fiesty at Fifty, and deals with a lot of otherwise taboo or unspoken topics in a relaxed manner. The Fittr podcast especially has found favour with listeners, he says, claiming to have over 7,000+ unique listeners within two months of the show. \u201cI see podcasting as an immersive experience,\u201d says Shinde, adding that most podcasts have kept to a typical chat-show-like format. According to PwC\u2019s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2019-2023 India, \u201cIndia\u2019s music, radio and podcasts market was worth \u20b95753Cr in 2018, up from \u20b93890Cr in 2014...Podcast listening has increased markedly in India in the past few years. Monthly listeners (defined as people who listened to at least one podcast in the last month) totalled 4Cr at the end of 2018, up a sharp 57.6% from 2.54Cr in the previous year. This made India the world\u2019s third-largest podcast-listening market (after China and the U.S.), although it ranks much lower on a per capita basis. Growth is set to continue over the forecast period with listener numbers set to increase at a 34.5% CAGR to 17.61Cr by 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiyush Shinde\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the reason Sweden-based audio streaming platform Spotify is targeting its India expansion plans with localised non-music content, like original podcasts. Launched just yesterday, these include a cricket podcast called 22 Yarns with former TV host Gaurav Kapur, a show on relationships called Love Aaj Kal, and a fictional thriller called Bhaskar Bose. Other global platforms like Audioboom, Overcast, Apple Podcasts also have had a slew of Indian shows with stars and independent content producers alike. "

      "\nXiaomi has partnered with five shadow banking and fintech firms for the service, which will audit the creditworthiness of customers and disburse loans\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp launched its online lending service in India on Tuesday, widening its offering of financial products in one of the world\u2019s biggest web services markets.Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Credit connects smartphone users with lending firms, giving them access to quick loans of up to 100,000 rupees ($1,393.34), the company's India head Manu Jain told reporters.The company has partnered with five shadow banking and fintech firms for the service, which will audit the creditworthiness of customers and disburse loans.Beijing-headquartered Xiaomi first moved into India\u2019s fast-growing financial services space in March with Mi Pay, which allows bill payments and money transfers.While smartphones are the core of its business, Xiaomi earns low margins from its affordable devices and relies on services for long-term profit.According to forecasts by research firm Boston Consulting Group, India\u2019s digital lending market may be worth $1 trillion by 2023.Mi Pay has already pitched the firm against global tech giants Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which offer similar services in India.\u201cFor now, India definitely is our biggest market outside China, not only in Credit but pretty much in everything else,\u201d said Hong Feng, the company\u2019s co-founder and senior vice-president.\u201cWe need to focus ourselves to make it really successful. We need to bring in more partners, bring more products, bring more users to make it really scale up. That\u2019s our focus for the next 12 months.\u201dXiaomi is not in a hurry to expand into more geographical regions, Feng added.In Indonesia, another key market, Xiaomi\u2019s financial unit had to shut down in late 2018 due to a disagreement with regulators over licensing.On Tuesday, Jain also sought to allay concerns over privacy of Mi Credit users in a country which is yet to make a law on data protection. User data is 100% encrypted and cannot be misused, Jain said.\u201cWe have strong data protection agreements with each of our partners that they cannot use this data for any other purpose, apart from giving loans to users,\u201d he added.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nJesper Kyd \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n Jesper Kyd has been composing music every day since he was 13. The Danish music composer\u2019s career goes beyond professional work. A browse through Jesper\u2019s Spotify artiste profile reveals he has an average of 4,10,505 monthly listeners. His fans are not just gamers though, given Jesper has written music for series such as Mortal  Kombat X and even 2018 Hindi film Tumbbad. The 47-year-old won a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Games Award in 2005 for Best Original Music for Hitman: Contracts.Jesper\u2019s hit list2019: Borderlands 32018: State Of Decay 2, Warhammer: Vermintide 22016: Assassin\u2019s Creed: The Ezio Collection2015: Warhammer: End Times \u2013 Vermintide, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel \u2013 Claptastic Voyage2014: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!, Sparta War Of Empires2013: State Of Decay2012: Borderlands 2, Darksiders II2011: Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations, Forza Motorsport 42010: Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood2009: Assassin\u2019s Creed: Bloodlines, Borderlands2007: Assassin\u2019s Creed, Kane & Lynch: Dead Men2006: Hitman: Blood Money2005: Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory2004: Hitman: Contracts2002: Minority Report, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin2000: Hitman: Codename 471994: Red Zone, The Adventures of Batman & RobinRecent projects continued to garner curious ears, particularly for the Assassin\u2019s Creed games and Borderlands 3. There are many different elements \u2014 drums, claps, bass \u2014 all melded into a varietal score which reflects the zany and wild nature of the Borderlands franchise. \u201cYou have to really immerse yourself into a project at the deepest level possible,\u201d says Jesper, who has worked on the franchise for almost 10 years. He adds, \u201cBorderlands is not the most serious game as it likes to poke fun at itself, but the composition and production itself is taken seriously, despite the game going into more comedic areas. Having said that, I know the people at Gearbox [the developers] well, especially audio lead and music director Raison Varner, and they know me as a composer.\u201d Jesper explains that the team at Gearbox had no requests around the music but rather that they let his creativity run free, making it a stress-free process. Composing for gaming at the beginning of a gaming project can be stressful, points out Jesper, given there are few visual elements. \u201cIt can feel forced to make music that is not ready to come out yet. You are trying to figure out way too many things. With Borderlands, it is helpful to know what the score has to become, because of the ranging story-lines.\u201dFor many gamers, music is a key hype-factor in gearing up for the game. Music for the initial menu screen has to pack a punch, after all. Jesper\u2019s strategy is all about venturing into the unexpected. \u201cI wanted something that would give you a taste of this massive world and experience; it is something I was aiming for. Even though you would be chilling at the menu screen, looking at your character, the music aims to give a certain depth, while also reminding you of what may not be on that screen. I love to remind people about what is present in that world or story, but not necessarily something they are watching or playing at that moment. There is the idea that if your player goes into a dark, scary cave and you have music much like that, then that is fine. But I believe that if you bring music, especially for an immersive platform like a video game, where the music goes beyond what is on screen, the experience is deepened.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Ezio Collection \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nJesper, like most veteran music professionals, does have his favourite hardware to work with: Doepfer LMK4+, Eurorack Modular, Yamaha CS-80, Prophet 10 and the Juno 60. But talk software and he favours Cubase (Steinberg), EQuality (DMG Audio), Ohmicide (Ohm Force), HD Cart (Reverb Foundry), and TC1210 (TC Electronic).But how has technology evolved to enhance composition for video games? \u201cIn early days, you would be at your studio, at the piano, and you would basically have the director come over and have a listen of what has been created. Now, however, the delivery of that music itself is different. I try to use both analogue and digital equipment to get the best of everything into a single mix. Technology also lets you meld different sounds into a score, such as choirs and screams. With Borderlands 3, some of the technology is the most advanced I have seen in my career as far as a music system is concerned. Let us say I take a piece of music for a part where the player is exploring a certain part of the world, such as a jungle, where there is an abandoned spaceship. At this point, the player is not engaged in combat but is more exploratory. This music is called \u2018exploration music\u2019 and is a three-minute piece divided into four or five sections. Those sections become modules which have to talk to each other. At the same time, I deliver those sections in front of layers.\u201d Jesper elaborates that, thanks to avenues of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, players can then see the possibilities of the permutations and orders of playing that music. Suddenly, the game is playing this unique soundtrack on the side, and remarkably, if the player revisits that part, the music may sound different. But Jesper says he is not worried about AI ever being a full-fledged composer, because composing is a very emotional and personal process.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe allegations may deepen legal troubles in the United States for TikTok, which is owned by Beijing ByteDance Technology Co but operates entirely outside of China and has developed an especially devoted fan base among U.S. teenagers\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n A California college student has accused popular video-sharing app TikTok in a class-action lawsuit of transferring private user data to servers in China, despite the company\u2019s assurances that it does not store personal data there.The allegations may deepen legal troubles in the United States for TikTok, which is owned by Beijing ByteDance Technology Co but operates entirely outside of China and has developed an especially devoted fan base among U.S. teenagers.The company is already facing a U.S. government national security probe over concerns about data storage and possible censorship of political sensitive content.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California last Wednesday and originally reported by The Daily Beast, alleges TikTok has surreptitiously \u201cvacuumed up and transferred to servers in China vast quantities of private and personally-identifiable user data.\u201dTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations, but maintains that it stores all U.S. user data in the United States with back-ups in Singapore.The documents identify the plaintiff as Misty Hong, a college student and resident of Palo Alto, California, who downloaded the TikTok app in March or April 2019 but never created an account.Months later, she alleges, she discovered that TikTok had created an account for her without her knowledge and produced a dossier of private information about her, including biometric information gleaned from videos she created but never posted.According to the filing, TikTok transferred user data to two servers in China \u2014 bugly.qq.com and umeng.com \u2014 as recently as April 2019, including information about the user\u2019s device and any websites the user had visited.Bugly is owned by Tencent, China\u2019s largest mobile software company, which also owns social network WeChat, while Umeng is part of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.The lawsuit also claims that source code from Chinese tech giant Baidu is embedded within the TikTok app, as is code from Igexin, a Chinese advertising service, which security researchers discovered in 2017 was enabling developers to install spyware on a user\u2019s phone.The legal documents did not provide evidence of the data transfers or the existence of Baidu or Igexin source code in the app. Hong and her legal representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nMeet environmental engineer Prasanth Omanakuttan, who is offering a solution to e-waste problem\n\n",
      "Updated: December 3, 2019 20:25 IST\rPublished: December 3, 2019 15:18 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/make-your-e-waste-count/article30148499.ece",
      "\nElectronics recycling\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n E-waste is a real threat, says Prasanth Omanakuttan during a tour of Green Era Recyclers, an e-waste recycling facility, located on the outskirts of Coimbatore. \u201cIt is the second-most threatening and hazardous waste, after radioactive or bio-medical waste. There are about 60 to 100 components in e-waste that are hazardous to consumers and the environment,\u201d he reveals, as we stop at a counter with CPUs and monitors neatly arranged on the shelves. \u201cThese are in perfect working condition and will easily last another three or four years,\u201d he says. Founder Prasanth and his team are doing just that. They reduce, reuse, recycle, refurbish, replenish and recover gadgets and give them an extended lease of life. They either repair them or reclaim parts from them to be used in other products. The plastics and steel are recycled, he says.\u2018Circuit\u2019 world: Fast computing devices like mobile phones, computers and laptops, use precious metals for quick transmission. The discarded circuit boards, processors, and rams are segregated, graded and then sent for recovery of those metals such as silver, platinum, palladium and gold and other base metals like copper and aluminium. Then they are sent to recycling units in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Steel, copper and aluminium are smelted and reused.Destroy: Data in the wrong hands is always a threat. Any CPU, laptop or USB, contains data, even after you format it. Anything deleted from a storage device can always be recovered. In corporates, IT companies and also those in manufacturing and design, data security is of foremost importance. The testing team secures confidential data in storage devices and ensures that the data is wiped off using a clinical methodology.Upcoming:Green Era Recyclers abides by the rules and regulations of the Central and State Pollution Control Board (CPCB and SPCB), Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). They plan to upgrade the facility so as to handle 1,000 to 1,500 tonnes of e-waste per year, catering to clients pan-India. On a pilot basis, they are working on a project along with the corporation to channelise e-waste collection from households. Instead of an additional bin for e-waste, they can collect e-waste as a part of dry waste and then later segregate it. Once successful, this can be replicated across the country.To know more, visit www.thegreenera.in or call 8300223526.One can only guess the volume of e-waste being generated. At the facility, electronic waste is piled up in every corner. Used computers, monitors, laptops, keyboards, printers, scanners, and tablets, share space with tonnes of wires and cables, and discarded refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, AC compressors, music systems and ear phones. There are fluorescent lamps too. \u201cWe are designing a machinery to powder the bulbs and trap the mercury content in it, before we send it to the hazardous waste disposal facility at Gummidipoondi in Chennai. One has to extract lead from computer monitors (every monitor has a lead coating) before we dispose them. Many electronics carry heavy metals such as mercury, lead, lithium, and other materials that pollute the air when incinerated or poison the ecosystem as they invade the landfills.\u201d There is no awareness or a channel to dispose e-waste, admits Prasanth.\u201cMy focus is on integrated e-waste management, where the waste is used as a by-product to make something new. For example, making plastic tiles with recycled plastics and power banks from discarded batteries.\u201dWhat led 25-year-old Prasanth, an environmental engineer, to e-waste, is the first question that pops up when we settle for a chat. He looks around his room and says, \u201cThere is a laptop, switch boxes, chargers, desktop... this small room alone has 100 kilograms of e-waste. Every household easily generates 100 to 200 kilograms.\u201dPrasanth emphasises that all old, usable or unusable electronic items can be refurbished or can be disposed in an environment-friendly manner. \u201cIndia is the fourth-largest contributor of e-waste after Europe, China and the US. We generate 2.5 million tonnes every year (with a 30% increase every year). Tamil Nadu is the second-largest contributor at 13%, which is about 3.5 lakh tonnes. The e-waste hubs in Delhi and Mumbai are choked. We need better infrastructure to handle the tonnes of e-waste.\u201dThe three-year-old start-up has so far recycled over 150 tonnes of e-waste and has reduced carbon footprint emission by 0.0034%. Green Era Recyclers is chosen as one of the top three start-ups in the environment field and is incubated at Vel Tech Technology Business Incubator (TBI), Chennai. \u201cWe are ideating on automation and digitisation. We will go for a prototype first and then pitch for funding.\u201d Government policies are in place, says Prasanth. For example, producers have to declare conformance to RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) in manufacturing, but more needs to be done. \u201cWe have a guideline for manufacture and supply. But what about disposal? It is so easy to buy an iPhone, but when I want to dispose it, I do not know where to go. In a start-up ecosystem, there are investors for block chain technology or AI, but when it comes to e-waste management, there is always a concern about returns. The government should come forward and support us with subsidies.\u201dSelf-realisation is important, he says. \u201cFrom ink pens, we have moved on to plastic ball pens. We use virgin paper instead of recycled paper. We have to value every single product, be it a bike or a gadget. Take an effort to repair and reuse. Don\u2019t give in to temptation whenever a new mobile phone hits the market (you have to worry about the EMIs too!).\u201dPrasanth says, on an average, an individual generates 1.2 to 1.8 kilograms of e-waste, annually. \u201cMy vision is to create a system for households to streamline e-waste. And, have a Waste Park where e-waste can be laid to rest.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " A new YouTube policy allows creators to upload video games with scripted or simulated violent content without bothering about getting automatically hit by age-restriction gates.The new policy which came into effect on Monday paved the way for making such video games available to everyone, including those who stated their age to be below 18 years. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a difference between real-world violence and scripted or simulated violence \u2014 such as what you see in movies, TV shows, or video games \u2014 so we want to make sure we\u2019re enforcing our violent or graphic content policies consistently,\u201d YouTube said in a product update. \u201cThere will be fewer restrictions for violence in gaming, but this policy will still maintain our high bar to protect audiences from real-world violence,\u201d the Google-owned video-sharing platform said. YouTube said it may still age-restrict content if violent or gory imagery is the sole focus of the video. For instance, if the video focuses entirely on the most graphically violent part of a video game.This policy enforcement update, however, does not change advertiser-friendly guidelines.So if a video is considered too violent for advertisers, it will continue to run the risk of being demonetised even if it is fine by YouTube\u2019s standards, The Verge reported.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nPraveen Tyagi, founder of EduisFun Technologies, during the launch of STEPapp on Monday.\n\u00a0 A new mobile application focusing on the gamification of learning for students, called the Student Talent Enchancement Program application (STEPapp), was unveiled in the city on Monday.The application has been used at 16 Eklavya Model International Schools, the government-run residential schools for tribals, for the last four months and has been designed by a team of 400 IITians over seven years, backed by EduisFun Technologies. The app provides education to students from kindergarten to Class XII through games across subjects focussing on students\u2019 interest.Praveen Tyagi, founder of EduisFun Technologies, said his journey to Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and then to teach young minds had been possible through education. \u201cIf you take my family as an example, two of my brothers are in IITs, all of us are where we are because we were pushed to learn and educate ourselves,\u201d he said.Mr. Tyagi said STEPapp\u2019s developers had made sure it is accessible, affordable, adaptive and attractive for those who want to build their future. \u201cSuccess is dependent on the learning exposure. If we are considering brick-and-mortar educational institutions, sports is next to learning and then comes infrastructure. I believe the content of education is what matters, irrespective of whether the learner is sitting at the G.D. Somani School or Eklavya Model International School,\u201d Mr. Tyagi said.Manisha Verma, principal secretary of State tribal development department, spoke about the inclusivity of the app. \u201cRecruiting quality teachers in tribal areas is a huge problem, because even if we provide permanent jobs with accommodation, a lot of the highly-qualified teachers do not want to shift their bases to tribal areas. This is why the students are lagging behind when it comes to interaction with trained professionals and broadening their mental horizon. STEPapp could help bridge this gap. Sixteen tribal schools have already been using the application for four months,\u201d she said.Author Sonia Golani spoke about how STEPapp will benefit women and young girls. \u201cThere are only 30% or less women enrolling in engineering colleges in India. I feel newer-age edutech applications like this will help Indian women unleash the huge untapped potential that they have in them to be economic leaders,\u201d she said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Putting Huawei on the entity list, as it is known, allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of U.S.-made goods to the company, and some more limited items made abroad that contain U.S. technology.But under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, prompting inter-agency discussions within the administration of President Donald Trump about possible changes to two key rules that could expand U.S. authority to block more foreign shipments to the company, giving more teeth to Huawei\u2019s blacklisting, according to two people familiar with the matter.The expansion of the rules is being considered even though the Trump Administration last week agreed to grant some reprieves on the existing ban and continues to seek a deal to de-escalate a bitter trade war.If the Commerce Department makes the proposed rule changes, it will allow U.S. authorities to regulate sales of non-sensitive items, such as standard cell phone chips, made abroad with U.S.-origin technology, software, or components to Huawei, which is the world's second largest smartphone maker.Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The changes would represent \u201ca major expansion of the reach of U.S. export controls and would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,\u201d said Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson.He predicted the actions would upset supply chains but that ultimately Huawei would find other companies to fill the gaps.One rule the Commerce Department and sister agencies are focused on broadening is known as the De Minimis rule, which dictates whether U.S. content in a foreign-made product gives the U.S. government authority to block an export, the people said.Officials also may expand the so-called Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign-made goods that are based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations.It is not clear how close the administration is to making a decision about the changes, nor whether they would be introduced gradually or suddenly. It also was not immediately clear how the rule-making might take place, though sources said the changes would likely affect only Huawei.Some China hawks within the administration are hoping for swift results, the people said.In the months after Huawei was added to the entity list, suppliers such as Intel Corp, Xilinx Inc and Micron Technology Inc resumed some shipments to the Chinese company after conducting internal reviews to assess what products were not subject to the ban.Xilinx Chief Executive Victor Peng, for example, told Reuters in July that the company determined that its older, 28-nanometer chips and some chips not designed for 5G gear could legally could be sold to Huawei without a special license. To sell to a blacklisted company, suppliers subject to U.S. rules generally need to apply for and receive a special license.Xilinx and the other companies did not explain why they decided they did not fall under the entity list ban.The new rule considerations come just days after the Commerce Department gave two important wins to the blacklisted company, whose suppliers need special licenses to sell Huawei U.S. manufactured products.Last week, the agency renewed the so-called temporary general license for Huawei for a third time, extending permission for it to engage in limited transactions to maintain U.S. rural network operators.And on Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a batch of some 75 licenses to allow some suppliers to restart sales to the company after Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist six months ago.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The action was to impact accounts belonging to the deceased.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard you on the impact that this would have on the accounts of the deceased. This was a miss on our part. We will not be removing any inactive accounts until we create a new way for people to memorialize accounts,\u201d Twitter said late on Thursday.\u201cThis impacts accounts in the EU only, for now. We\u2019ve always had an inactive account policy but we haven\u2019t enforced it consistently. We\u2019re starting with the EU in part due to local privacy regulations (eg. GDPR),\u201d it added.The company had said that as part of its commitment to serve the public conversation, it is working to clean up inactive accounts to present more accurate, credible information people can trust across the platform.In a fresh post, it said: \u201cBeyond complying with GDPR, we may broaden the enforcement of our inactivity policy in the future to comply with other regulations around the world and to ensure the integrity of the service. We will communicate with all of you if we do. We apologize for the confusion and concerns we caused and will keep you posted.\u201dFacebook lets dead users\u2019 friends and family report them as deceased and set up a special page for sharing memories about that person.Twitter currently does not have a way to memorialise someone\u2019s account once they have passed on, but the team is thinking about ways to do this.Any account that hasn\u2019t signed in for more than six months will receive the Twitter alert before the micro-blogging platform takes the action.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe unmanned aerial vehicle weighs 1.5 kg and has an estimated top speed of 200 kmph.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Hardware prototyping centre and makerspace T Works test-flew a fully 3D printed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 50 km from Hyderabad.The UAV featured a range of 3D printed parts from materials such as PLA (Polylactic Acid), ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene). The UAV, which weighs 1.5 kg and has an estimated top speed of 200 kmph, was designed, 3D printed and assembled in-house at T Works. The test results will be used to analyse the structural and aerodynamic properties for future applications of 3D printed UAVs.CEO of T Works Sujai Karampuri said, \u201c3D printing allows low-risk and fast-track prototyping. There were days when people would spend 400-500 hours shaping every single part of a model aircraft with balsa wood and plywood. Today, prototyping has become so easy wherein we only need to design on computers and 3D printers will bring our creations to reality.\u201dRapid prototyping (3D Printing) will reduce the drudgery in making aircraft, allowing people to experiment with more innovative designs. The UAV took 100 hours to design and 3D print, after which the parts were slot-fitted and assembled without any nuts, bolts or screws.The series of experiments by T Works will serve as a test bed for new autonomous technologies and potential 3D printing applications in the aerospace industry.The team experimented with different internal \u2018infill\u2019 structures and found a honeycomb-like structure to be the most effective and lightweight for the purpose of structural strengthening for thin-walled structures. The team also developed a custom lithium polymer battery pack and found innovative ways to use micro-controllers for serial communication, which significantly reduced cost and complexity.An initiative of the Telangana government, T Works will have state-of-the-art prototyping equipment run by a dedicated team of some of the best design, engineering and fabrication talent in India. According to Mr. Karampuri, T Works, under construction currently, will commence operations in five months. It will also host an advanced aero modelling workshop in December, where participants will design, build and fly their own UAVs.

      "\nA screegrab from the TikTok video \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nTwitter/feroza.x  Social media app TikTok apologised to a user on Thursday for removing a video that criticised China's treatment of Muslims, blaming a \u201chuman moderation error\u201d and saying the images had been restored within less than an hour.The controversy over the video, viewed 1.6 million times, comes as TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, faces an inquiry by a U.S. national security panel over its handling of personal data, while U.S. lawmakers fear it may be censoring politically sensitive content.In the video she posted last week, the user, who identifies herself as Feroza Aziz, gave a tutorial on eyelash curling, while talking about how Muslims were being treated, and saying she wanted to spread awareness of the situation.But on Twitter this week she said she had been blocked from posting on TikTok for a month, and on Wednesday posted that her viral video had been taken down, only to be restored later.The video was offline for 50 minutes, TikTok said on its website.\u201cWe would like to apologise to the user for the error on our part,\u201d said Eric Han, the app's U.S. head of safety.\u201cDue to a human moderation error, the viral video from November 23 was removed. It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,\u201d he said. The TikTok user did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for additional comment.China's foreign ministry said it had no specifics of the case, when queried by Reuters about the incident on Wednesday.But it added that it required Chinese firms to operate in a way that respected international norms and local laws and regulations, and hoped that relevant countries also provided a fair and non-discriminatory environment.TikTok is not available in China, but ByteDance has a domestic version called Douyin.The user did not mention Uighurs in the video, but said later on Twitter she had been referring to the minority ethnic group.United Nations experts and rights groups estimate more than a million Uighurs and members of other ethnic groups have been detained in camps in China's far western region of Xinjiang, which has triggered international condemnation.China says the camps are vocational training centres to impart new skills and help root out and prevent extremism.ByteDance has stepped up efforts to ring-fence TikTok, popular with U.S. teenagers and those in their 20s, from much of its Chinese operations, Reuters reported on Thursday.In a timeline on its blog post, TikTok said it had blocked another account set up by Ms. Aziz that had posted an image of Osama Bin Laden which violated its content policies regarding \u201dterrorist imagery\u201d.On Monday, it enforced a device ban on accounts associated with violations. This affected the new account from which Ms. Aziz had posted the eyelash curling video and sent from the same device, it said.It said it had decided to override the device ban and was directly contacting her to do so.Ms. Aziz confirmed on Twitter that TikTok had restored her account but said other past videos had been deleted.\u201cDo I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a three-part video about the Uyghurs? No,\u201d she posted on Twitter.

      "\n\nAmazon Web Services readies more powerful data centre chip: Sources\n\n",

      "\nThe new Amazon Web Services chip uses technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned Arm Holdings, the sources said. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud computing unit has designed a second, more powerful generation of data centre processor chip, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, the latest sign that the company is pouring money into custom silicon for its fastest-growing business.The new Amazon Web Services chip uses technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned Arm Holdings, the sources said. One of the sources familiar with the matter said it will be at least 20% faster than Amazon\u2019s first Arm-based chip, named Graviton, which was released last year as a low-cost option for easier computing tasks.If Amazon Web Services\u2019 chip efforts are successful, it could lessen the unit\u2019s reliance on Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc for server chips.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on future products or services. Arm declined to comment.In cloud computing, businesses rent out servers from Amazon instead of running their own data centres. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s cloud unit to generate $34.9 billion in sales in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Cloud computing has become big business for data centre chip makers. Intel controls more than 90% of the server processor market, with AMD controlling most of the remainder. Intel\u2019s data centre group generated almost of half of the company\u2019s overall operating profit last year.And most server chips go to the cloud. In 2018, almost 65% of Intel\u2019s data centre chip sales were from cloud and communications service providers, its executives have said.Chip designers using Arm technology want to challenge Intel\u2019s dominance. Arm chips power mobile phones today. But several companies aim to make them suitable for data centres, including start-ups run by former executives from Intel and Apple Inc.Amazon\u2019s first Arm chip did not appear to have an impact on Intel\u2019s data centre business, which continued to grow over the past year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. But he said major technology companies, who spend billions each year with Intel and AMD with few alternatives, have the resources to make more powerful Arm chips.Amazon\u2019s Arm effort appears to be making progress, one of the sources said. The new chip\u2019s speed gain \u201csends a message to the market\u201d that Amazon is serious about investing in Arm-based chips, the person said.Both sources familiar with the matter said the new chip is not expected to be as powerful as Intel\u2019s \u2018Cascade Lake\u2019 or AMD\u2019s \u2018Rome\u2019 chips.Though less powerful, Arm chips are cheaper and consume less electricity than Intel\u2019s top-end chips. Intel\u2019s most powerful chips can cost several thousand dollars, while barebones Arm-based server chips can cost less than $1,000.In a data centre that houses tens of thousands of servers, chip buyers often focus on a mix of factors \u2014 speed, chip size, power consumption and cooling costs \u2014 called the \u2018total cost of ownership.\u2019 That is where Arm-based offerings hope to one day compete with Intel.Amazon\u2019s first Graviton chip used Arm\u2019s older Cortex A72 technology. The forthcoming Amazon chip is expected to use newer Arm technology, most likely Arm\u2019s Neoverse N1 technology, one of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Another source familiar with the matter said the chip is expected to have at least 32 cores versus the Graviton\u2019s 16.The new chip will also use a technology called a \u201cfabric\u201d that will allow it to connect with other chips to speed up tasks like image recognition, one of the people familiar with the matter said.To take advantage of the new chip, cloud customers likely will need to use software written for Arm-based chips, which is less common than software for Intel and AMD chips.\u201cThe hardware is only part of the equation,\u201d the second source familiar with the matter told Reuters.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Chinese technology company is seeking to provide assurances to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that personal data held by TikTok, which is widely popular with U.S. teenagers, is stored securely in the United States \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n ByteDance has stepped up efforts to separate its social media app TikTok from much of its Chinese operations, amid a U.S. national security panel\u2019s inquiry into the safety of the personal data it handles, people familiar with the matter said.The Chinese technology company is seeking to provide assurances to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that personal data held by TikTok, which is widely popular with U.S. teenagers, is stored securely in the United States and will not be compromised by Chinese authorities, the sources said.CFIUS, which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, is looking into ByteDance\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of social media app Musical.ly in 2017, which laid the foundations for TikTok\u2019s rapid growth, Reuters reported earlier this month.ByteDance\u2019s response represents a key test of corporate China\u2019s ability to operate businesses in the United States that handle personal data, as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China fans suspicion between the world\u2019s two largest economies.ByteDance is hoping to avoid the fate of Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd, which said in May it would agree to a CFIUS request to divest popular gay dating app Grindr following concerns about the security of personal data. It is also exploring exiting its investment in Grindr through an initial public offering.ByteDance started to separate TikTok operationally before CFIUS approached it in October, because it wanted some of its staff to focus on TikTok, according to the sources.It completed the separation of TikTok\u2019s product and business development, marketing and legal teams from those of its Chinese social media app Douyin in the third quarter of this year, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the company\u2019s internal arrangements.During the summer, it also hired an external consultant to carry out audits on the integrity of the personal data it stores, the sources added. The company has said U.S. user data is stored entirely in the United States, with a backup in Singapore. It has also said that the Chinese government does not have any jurisdiction over TikTok content.Following the approach by CFIUS, TikTok is making a new push to set up a team in Mountain View, California, that will oversee data management, according to the sources. This team will determine whether Chinese-based engineers should have access to TikTok\u2019s database, and monitor their activity, the sources said.TikTok is also hiring more U.S. engineers to reduce its reliance on staff in China, according to the sources.It is not clear how effective these changes will be in appeasing CFIUS. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, said it does not comment on information relating to specific CFIUS cases.\u201cShifting a company\u2019s operations away from China, geographically and technically, can give CFIUS more comfort that the company is really independent of its Chinese owner and the Chinese government,\u201d said Nevena Simidjiyska, a partner at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP who advises companies on CFIUS reviews and is not involved in the TikTok case.TikTok employs about 400 people in the United States, up from 20 people at the time of the Musical.ly acquisition, the sources said. Most of the new employees joined this year, as TikTok built its U.S. operations, the sources added. ByteDance has 50,000 employees around the world.U.S. lawmakers called last month for a national security probe into TikTok, expressing concern that the Chinese company may be censoring politically sensitive content, and raising questions about how it stores personal data. Last week, U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the U.S. military is undertaking a security assessment of TikTok.Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose social media platform competes with TikTok for younger users, has also criticised the app over censorship concerns.The CFIUS probe is currently focused on the handling of personal data, rather than censorship, according to two of the sources. ByteDance views the CFIUS investigation as informal, and has not yet been subjected to an official review, one of the sources added.Some of the personal data that TikTok stores, such as a person\u2019s name, age, email address and phone number, is submitted by its users. Other information, related to a person\u2019s location, is collected automatically, according to TikTok\u2019s website. TikTok also stores user-generated content, such as photographs and videos.Launched just two years ago, TikTok has been downloaded 1.5 billion times, making it the third most downloaded non-gaming app of the year, after Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp and Messenger apps, according to research firm SensorTower.ByteDance is one of China\u2019s fastest growing start-ups. It owns the country\u2019s leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry.ByteDance counts Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group Corp, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and private equity firms such as KKR & Co Inc, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRed Bull River Runes contest set-up\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n As one nears Hyderabad International Convention Centre, the ground throbs with excitement and the flags peppering the lanes leading to India Game Developer Conference (IGDC), ripple in the wind. Inside the convention hall are behemoth screens, shifting light shows and hundreds of smiling people bustling around.IGDC was formerly known as NASSCOM Game Developers Conference; it went under a re-branding given the international pull of the conference. Much like the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and ChinaJoy in Shanghai, there are exclusive opportunities for gamers, whatever the scale of their interest.The conference provided meet-cues between investors and gaming developers across the country and most of them took the form of immersive panels which included \u2018Strategies for finding and vetting good partners for your company\u2019 with Jay Powell and \u2018Indian Market - Status Quo\u2019 which featured Shubh Malhotra of MPL Gaming, Shalu Jhunjhunwala of Google and Vikash Jaiswal of Gametion, among others. \n\n\n\n\n\nPencils & Pixels\u2019 Traditional C Digital Art Competition\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nOne of the attendees, Vijay K N, a future game designer, says he found the Indian Market - Status Quo panel quite riveting. \u201cI wanted to know the realistic hurdles coming my way. In the creative industry, it is more important to know the business side of things so that you don\u2019t get taken advantage of. There are still cases where game designers or studios have unwittingly handed over their property without seeing the legal side of it properly. \u201d Talks such as this also lay the foundation for jargon and help the creatives stay in tune with the headlines in their industry without feeling overwhelmed.A particularly packed seminar was a fireside chat with Vishnu Cherikkandi of Tencent Games. One of the platform\u2019s creations \u2014 a little thing called PUBG \u2014 created quite a stir this year with its continual antagonism with India\u2019s courts and concerned parents alike. Not many people realise India is a major centre for the performance capture and motion capture we see in major games including Hitman, Control and Borderlands 3. Companies such as Hyderabad-based Firebolt Entertainment and Mumbai-based Centroid Motion Capture drew quite a few young hopefuls around career goals and even just inside knowledge on their favourite experiences. Centroid director Parth Shah is excited to bring the studio from London and Belgium to India finally where thousands of talented people can get in on the back-end development of gaming. \u201cIt\u2019s time the world knows India is where it\u2019s at!\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo attendees play Red Dead Redemption 2 \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nClearly, democracy in the access to gaming tools was very much on the agenda at IGDC 2019, and much in agreement with this is Quentin Staes-Polet of Epic Games, the studio behind the well-known Unreal Engine and games such as Fortnite and Paragon. Having worked in the gaming industry for almost 10 years, he is all about creating new connections between the Indian market and Unreal Engine, a suite of integrated tools for game developers to design and build games. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start supporting this big group of Indian gaming developers. Unreal will also make up a big part of Epic Games\u2019 education scheme. Because of Fortnite\u2019s global growth, we are ready to find the many developers out there, who are ready to work with AI and Machine Learning. We\u2019ve seen so many developers with other approaches to design. Yes, it\u2019s a competitive market and access to distribution is unequal. We want to make it less expensive for those who have ideas to develop their ideas at a low cost but still get a good result.\u201d League Of Legends fanatics leaned into Jayson Keyser\u2019s talk \u2018From VFX to Creation\u2019 which details the exhaustive world of designing open-world games with precision and skill. \u201cVFX comprises an evolving formula and you keep building on it. The quality of the developers makes the quality of the final result; League Of Legends has had a four-year working cycle. But I\u2019ve got to say, one of my pet peeves in game design is when the frame rate drops.\u201d Jayson heads up California-based VFX Apprentice where he\u2019s an educator and artist.It is worth noting that IGDC did not have many people posed with their phones in the air for selfies. Unlike Comic Con India, there is no cosplay; here, people mean business \u2014 especially in competitive e-sports. NODWIN Esports Arena held one corner of the colourful room where the ESL India Premiership \u2013 Fall Finale was taking place. Were it not for the powerful air conditioning, everyone, including spectators, would be drenched in stress-sweat. Out of the end of this gruelling competition came four winners: Samith for Clash Royale \u2013 8Bit Smoke, SynerGE Retribution for Brawl Stars, Global Esports for DOTA 2, Orgless5ive for CSGO. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the players at the Red Bull River Runes contest \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nOne of the most popular games in the industry, Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow 6 Siege India Series, had a competition too, and the winner was Vector Sports. But no one in the premises could miss the huge Red Bull River Runes contest which saw G.E. Micro (Sahil Kishor Viradia) take the trophy home.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set-up for the e-sports session for Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow 6 Siege India Series, \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nPencils & Pixels also had young graphic designers and animators competing in Traditional C Digital Art while there were also opportunities for offline competitions such as plasticine-moulding or even with popular board games. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the offline competitions saw a participant creating The Last Stag from Hollow Knight \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nRajesh Rao is the mastermind behind NGDC and IGDC. Having been chairperson at NASSCOM Gaming Forum for 11 years as well as founder at Dhruva Interactive, it is fair to say Rajesh is on the pulse of what people want in regards to gaming, not just what\u2019s hot in the industry. In an interview ahead of the conference, he shares, \u201cHyderabad is a great location because the Government of Telangana is really supportive in their recognition of gaming and visual effects as real industries. Seeing the build-up, I just wish I were 25 and starting now! Being an entrepreneur in this space is exciting; back in my day, we struggled and there was no business cases to it, it was purely passion-driven. Everything is lining up now; there are more resources and newer technologies.\u201d This year\u2019s IGDC saw over 3000 people in attendance and more than 200 industry speakers.

Similar to Instagram, one can also mute accounts, privatise your own account, make certain posts private, file reports against anti-guideline posts and one can even unlist posts. You can also block accounts, disable comments, hide follower counts, set up content warnings for more sensitive or triggering posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nPixelfed\u2019s logo \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nPixelfed.org\n \n\n\n\n\nThe design interface also looks quite similar to Instagram with the ability to \u2018heart\u2019, comment and share posts, as well as a Discover tab to reach out to other content creators on the site. However, unlike Instagram \u2014 who may not be affected much by this \u2014 and like Mastodon there\u2019s no singular eponymous app... though the logo looks amusingly similar to that of Picasa by Google. The Documentation section of the site disclaims, \u201cPixelfed is still a work in progress. We do not recommending running an instance in production at this stage unless you know what you are doing!\u201dBrowse the official website and one will notice Pixelfed\u2019s first blog post was dated April 27 of this year, however on October 26, a blog post titled \u2018Urgent security issue...\u2019 stated, \u201cWe have become aware of a new security risk that has emerged within the past few days. This exploit is bad...\u201dIt is important to note that this isn't an issue with the Pixelfed software, but with a web and PHP server combination (nginx and php-fpm) that some people running instances of Pixelfed might be using, and since people can host their own instances of Pixelfed. Basically, this blog post, serving as a public service announcement, was made to inform those people as it affects many websites running that combination of software. Hopefully, these security measures in the coding and back-end of the platform have been ironed out.A simple Google search of Pixelfed also brings up forum-based discussions, too. One particular forum from 8 months ago at YCombinator.com dissects the possibilities of what Pixelfed would mean. One user in the forum discussion mentioned, \u201cTo be fair, Pixelfed is in its early shoes. I know it from an \u2018alternatives to Facebook etc\u2019 list but it still has to gain some traction like Mastodon. However \u2014 and that's the problem \u2014 as long as you build an ethical service you probably won't reach the masses, because non-ethical platforms will always outperform you, and if it's just by how much they spend on marketing.\u201dMastodon has been vocal about their sustenance coming from seed funding, much like Pixelfed. The platform is open to funding via popular digital funding site Patreon and from their sponsor Oscillas, a business automation firm.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe team of boys from St Joseph Academy \u00a0 Excitement writ large on their faces, their eagerness to show what they designed was palpable.They were also thrilled at the thought of getting to play a game or two. At the India Game Developer Conference (IGDC), teams of young participants came to demonstrate the games they had created. Standing behind their desks, dressed in their school uniform, Shreyash Laxmi Narayan, Mihir Rao and Rushil Yadav, the VIII Std students of Shiv Nadar School in Gurugram explain their game \u2018Dimensions switch\u2019, which begins with a question, \u2018Who will save the world now?\u2019 Once you select \u2018I will\u2019 the player enters. The trio took part in a design championship with the game as they wanted to try something new after trying different design applications like Scratch (a free programming language for use in creating interactive stories, games, and animations) and MID. It was their first game, and the trio says it took them two weeks to develop it. Do they love technology? \u201cYes, very much,\u201d pat came the reply in unison. \u201cThis is our first opportunity and we feel really excited to see so many other gamers under one roof. Hoping to meet and speak to some game developers to understand how they work on different programs,\u201d says Mihir Rao. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe team of boys from Shiv Nadar School Gurgaon. (L-R: Rushil Yadav, Mihir Rao, Shreyansh Lakshmi Narayan)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Mihir speaks, Rushil and Shreyansh prepare for a demo of the game and explain, \u201cWe use fire and ice against each other as a weapon to get into the next dimension.\u201d They are now looking to go back and see how to make it into different stages and let their friends try it.Standing next to them is a team of students from St Joseph\u2019s Academy, Ooty, Tamil Nadu. The four boys, Kim Eldon, F Fazil, Harish Balaji and Mohammed Saif studying in VII std take turns to explain the different aspects of the game and the way they developed it. They reveal that they attended and won at the design championship so they created a game called Miniscule for IGDC. The single-player game involves 31 bullets and 21 enemies. The idea of the game was perceived by Harish and Fazil and the characters were designed by Kim and Fazil using C Sharp coding. The game is in two design stages in which player can revive themself after almost meeting their end.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nThe rising popularity of Tamil YouTube\n\n",
      "Updated: November 29, 2019 10:04 IST\rPublished: November 26, 2019 14:06 IST",

      "\nYouTube creators at the Pop-UP space in Chennai\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n We have all watched Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX defy the laws of logic with its innovating concepts like reusable boosters (the ones that return to land after launching a rocket instead of diving into the sea).But what if someone told you the basic principle behind this technology is similar to balancing a stick on your index finger (aligning the object\u2019s mass in line with its centre of gravity)?Breaking down complex concepts into easily graspable bits of science in the Tamil language is what Premanand Sethurajan\u2019s YouTube channel, Let\u2019s Make Engineering Simple (LMES), is adept at. When he started on YouTube, almost five years ago, videos by LMES hardly received 100 views. Today, the average viewership is upwards of 1.5 lakh. At over 9 lakh users, the channel\u2019s subscription base too has grown substantially.The case is similar with Nakkalites, a popular Tamil language entertainment channel on YouTube. Founded by Prasanna Balachandran and 27-year-old visual communication graduate, Rajeshwar K, Nakkalites currently boast a subscription count north of two million. Almost all of their videos earn an average views count of one million.The immense growth in popularity of Tamil language YouTube channels has not gone unnoticed by the California-based video sharing platform, which recently organised a YouTube Pop-Up space in Chennai, where it invited hundreds of content creators to collaborate and create videos while sharing information on their processes. \u201cIn 2018, we had only 30 Tamil creators who had crossed the one-million subscriber mark, but in less than a year, this number has grown to 94,\u201d says Satya Raghavan, director, YouTube content partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\n(extreme left) Satya Raghavan, director, YouTube content partnerships, with Tamil language YouTube content creators\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cThrough Pop-Up, we want to continue to invest in growth of creators and handhold aspiring ones to learn from the creator community,\u201d he adds. LMES was not a direct beneficiary of Pop-Up spaces through its formative years, but, adds Premanand, the event allows content creators like him to meet new people, and even opens up cross-collaboration opportunities.While one of YouTube\u2019s revenue share models suggests that it splits 55% of advertising revenue with creators, channels like LMES have now outgrown the platform. \u201cI cannot sustain the company with just the ad-share revenue model from YouTube,\u201d says Premanand, who has recently launched a learning app and hosts workshops and events in collaboration with schools and other educational institutions.Nakkalites, too, has organically managed to grow to a level where it can resist corporate overtures, the kind that saw channels like Put Chutney being absorbed into content creation umbrella firms like Culture Machine. \u201cWe have received a lot of investment opportunities over the years but we turned them all away because we cannot work with complete freedom once we enter into such an arrangement,\u201d explains Rajeshwar.\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube creators at the Pop-UP space in Chennai\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0And that has been the key for their growth. Nakkalites boasts a family audience for its content, and grabs eyeballs for videos that are \u201crooted to reality and has a regional flavour,\u201d Rajeshwar adds.The four-day event saw more than 500 content creators participate, of which, says Raghavan, more than 50% were non-Chennaiites, pointing at the significance of Internet penetration in tier-II and tier-III cities as well as in rural Tamil Nadu. \u201cWith every passing year, newer cities have emerged as centres of excellence. Content in languages like Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam are doing really well,\u201d he adds.Big DataOf the 460 million Internet users in India in 2019, at least 265 million visit or access YouTube on a monthly basis.India adds nearly 40 million new Internet users every year. All of them are expected to log on to YouTube at least once after going online; of these, more than 60% of the new users are not located in India\u2019s six metropolitan cities.There are 1,200 Indian channels with over one million subscribers. Of these, 120 channels are run by women content creators.There are 94 Tamil channels at the moment, with over one million subscribers each. As many as 1,250 Tamil channels have between 1,00,000 and one million subscribers.The possibility of increased engagement via YouTube also reflects in standard practices adopted by Tamil cinema as well. For over a year now, filmmakers have attempted the two or three-trailer strategy, as Raghavan puts it, where the producers create buzz on social media platforms through motion posters, teasers and trailers uploaded to YouTube. \u201cThe engagement that our movie partners get on their trailers has a high correlation with their box office yields,\u201d he adds.There is, of course, an element of misuse (with fake or misleading content) that comes into play when both the platform and the supply chain grows exponentially and at a much faster rate. The problem of fake or misleading content is an issue, especially when such content can reach and influence Internet-empowered new age citizens of this country, who would be going online for the first time in 2020 and beyond. More than hate speech or the inclusion of profanity, it is the whataboutery in such content \u2014 something that channels like Premanand\u2019s have been waging a battle against \u2014 that can undermine the growth of Tamil language content.\u201cYouTube\u2019s genesis is that it is an open platform. Our thing is not about censorship. Having said that, we have very strong community guidelines, and we also work with the respective Governments to maintain the law of the land,\u201d Raghavan adds.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nThis Indian-made book has a chapter written by Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "Updated: November 28, 2019 16:12 IST\rPublished: November 25, 2019 17:13 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jaspreet-bindra-the-tech-whisperer-interview-2019/article30076761.ece",
      "In the 1950s, the fathers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy loosely defined AI as \u201cany task performed by a program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the task.\u201d Where did we find this nugget of tech history? From a chapter written by AI on AI. Yes, you read that right. Adding to the list of AI achievements, including AI composing music and creating paintings, this would perhaps be the first time in publishing history that AI writes about itself.In a detailed summary of Jaspreet Bindra\u2019s The Tech Whisperer: On Digital Transformation and the Technologies that Enable It (Penguin India, \u20b9599), AI has analysed, among other questions, whether it will replace livelihoods or create jobs, whether it will create a more humane society or an amoral world. On the surface, it is hard to tell if an AI or a human being wrote the chapter because the writing combines logic, facts, and structure. On in-depth reading (which was done to nitpick, to support the argument that AI can never replace humans), what was found wanting was a person\u2019s humane, conversational voice and descriptive style that makes a piece of writing a joy to read. The chapter was packed with facts, but is that enough to make it worth a read? That is a subjective question. The idea behind creating an AI engine to write, however, is definitely innovative.\n\n\n\n\n\nJaspreet, an expert on digital transformation, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, says, \u201cThe idea came to me when I was watching the video on how IBM\u2019s Project Debater competed against debating champion Harish Natarajan. This followed other man-versus-machine contests: Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov, Watson defeating Jeopardy! champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, AlphaGo developed by Google DeepMind destroying Lee Sedol the undefeated champion of the strategy game Go... AI has also painted, created music... but, in my knowledge, had not yet published a chapter in a book! It was then that I thought what if AI can write on AI, on itself?\u201dTo explore this possibility, Jaspreet got in touch with Anand Mahurkar, CEO of Findability Sciences, a Boston-based AI company. \u201cThe team built an AI engine which could write about itself.\u201d Jaspreet describes the process of how the engine was built. \u201cFindability Sciences used a product called FP-Summary\u2122 which is an innovative unsupervised method for automatic sentence extraction using proprietary algorithms, to crunch reams of unstructured data on AI that I gave it (from Wikipedia, etc), and created a full 37 page chapter on itself!\u201dThe rest of the book is not just meant for tech nerds, it is even for those who have hardly any knowledge or real interest in technology. \u201cIt is a book for everyone \u2014 digital practitioners as well as the many people who are intrigued/fascinated by technology, but are also a little scared by it.\u201dThe book also goes in-depth about companies that are looking to keep pace with rapid digital transformation. Even tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft (written extensively about in the book) have had to re-invent themselves in the face of digital transformation. \u201cThe book is divided into two parts. The first is largely focussed on corporate management and employees who want to bring technology into their company. This part focusses on defining digital transformation, describing what it is, and detailing practically how companies can make this happen. The second part demystifies and simplifies complex technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, Internet of Things, virtual reality, among others.\u201d Even though the Internet has an abundance of articles on technology that you can skim through, the depth and the clarity with which Jaspreet has written about emerging technology provides a more nuanced understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn why he calls himself the tech whisperer, Jaspreet says, \u201cJust as there are horse and dog whisperers, I am a tech whisperer, who has specialised knowledge for companies to engage with technological transformation. I do realise that it is a cacophonous world we live in. We look at our phone more than 2,000 times every day, to try and take in the half a million tweets, the 100,000 Instagram photos, 50 million WhatsApp messages which are sent every minute. Then there are the videos, the old and new social networks, the emails, and somewhere in the middle of all of this, a human being who actually wants to talk to you! As each of them tries to grab your attention, they try and shout louder and louder, they blink, they pop out, they transform themselves to emojis. I believe that a whisper can be heard far more loudly than a scream. Therefore, I have dredged into my experience to collect all these whispers.\u201dAs for whether AI will replace human beings, Jaspreet says that prediction is too extreme. \u201cAI will make some jobs redundant: jobs which are repetitive and mechanical \u2014 like data entry operators, paralegals, etc. However, as the Chinese AI guru Kai-Fu Lee posits, the jobs with high creativity and high compassion will remain and grow.\u201d In fact, the 272-page book explores how AI might be effective in creating alternative jobs in place of redundant ones.Jaspreet is quite the innovator, even when it comes to launching his book. In the Delhi launch, there was an AI painting and in Chennai, Jaspreet says, \u201cThe launch will be on November 29 at The Raintree, Anna Salai, at 4 pm. We are planning a quiz with Gaurav Sri Krishna... which will feature an AI.\u201d Only time will tell if humans will win the intelligence game.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nTurn up the heat with 'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' and 'Need For Speed: Heat'\n\n",
      "Updated: November 26, 2019 14:10 IST\rPublished: November 25, 2019 17:07 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/gamespot-review-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-need-for-speed-heat/article30076675.ece",
      "Yes, this week, it\u2019s all about the two universes that have had our controllers jockeying for a binge-session....Star Wars has always been about flashy Jedis, weird aliens and cute robots. And the newest droid on the block is BD-1. The energetic and agile BD-1 doubles as a chic, talkative backpack that dispenses healing items. It is one of the best parts of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.The game is set after Revenge of the Sith, in the aftermath of Order 66, which saw the Empire purge all Jedis. Cal Kestis is a refugee hiding in a scrapyard of a planet when the purge comes knocking at his door. A chance rescue throws him on a mission that could resurrect the fallen order of Jedis.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderDeveloper: Respawn EntertainmentPublisher: Electronic ArtsPrice: \u20b93499 for the PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox OneThe mission takes you across the galaxy with the crew of the Mantis. The colourful cast brings the typical Star Wars feel, with the exception of Cal, who sounds bored in all scenarios with zero charisma. Cal\u2019s character tries very much to be a young Nathan Drake but comes up short. It is the worst part of the game.Fallen Order is about discovery and combat. The slide-and-jump sequences whilst exploring reminds you of the Lara Croft series. The levels are designed like a metroidvania game with certain areas locked until you get new powers. The lightsaber combat is very Sekiro-inspired, with aggressive duels with Stormtroopers and massive aliens. While it is not as tough as a Souls game, it still is challenging. Fallen Order is a mix of game types that work surprisingly well together.\n\n\n\n\n\nFallen Order looks like a big-budget Star Wars movie, from the massive set pieces to superb sound. Technically, it is marred by a lot of glitches and ibugs. It is easy to veer off the path and finding the nearest shortcut is tedious in the byzantine levels.We have waited long for an excellent Star Wars game and now finally we get one with the lightsaber straight out of the movies and some incredible sequences.The last few years have not been good for the Need for Speed series. So it is understandable why Heat, the latest Need for Speed game, had a quiet launch. Yet, Heat is far from the duds of the past and, in fact, harks back to the 2000s, when the first The Fast and the Furious movie made street racing cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou play a new racer who has come to Palm City, a hotbed of street racing. To tackle the menace, a rogue police force turns up the heat on errant speedsters. You have to fight your way up the ranks to be the best. And, you need to tolerate the terrible story and hammy voice-acting.Need for Speed: HeatDeveloper: Ghost GamesPublisher: Electronic ArtsPrice: \u20b93499 for the PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox OneThe way to the top is earning rep and the best rewards come with risk. While you can take part in sanctioned events during the day, the real beasts come out to play at night. Palm City looks gorgeous, clad in neon. And, you earn money and rep winning exhilarating races, wherein you are always a hairpin turn away from getting busted. But the risks are worth the rewards as you get some cool upgrades and clothes.The game gets tough with physics-defying cars and cops who seem to bust you in seconds. Heat does not play fair at times. Thankfully, the cars are good. Once you get a hang of the drifting and handling, you can use the environment to outsmart the AI.While Heat looks and plays excellent, the street racing genre that peaked in Need For Speed: Most Wanted feels dated. Even the Fast and the Furious movies pivoted around heists. While it admirably tries to resuscitate the culture, it succeeds in taking you on a ride down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts has got two hits, which it badly needed, with Need for Speed: Heat and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. It seems as though the gaming giant is back on track."

Platforms like California-based Lumanu are working on protecting influencers in the campaigns they work on, and in their interactions with brands.Leanne Perice, founder of talent management company, Music Brand Agency \u2014 that represents singer Teyana Taylor and lifestyle blogger/influencer Helen Owen, among other musicians, digital celebrities and content creators \u2014 works with Lumanu for her clients. She has experience brokering millions of dollars in deals for product placement and integrated branding campaigns across digital and traditional media, and works with top agencies and brands in verticals ranging from beauty and lifestyle to consumer products. In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu Weekend, she breaks down what influencers need to know to safeguard their work.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeanne Perice \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore signing off on any deal, I negotiate the usage rights for my clients according to the general scope of work. I take several factors into consideration, such as the contact term length, exclusivity, deliverables, and talent fee. Based on this, I am able to determine the appropriate usage. The usage is where a lot of security concerns come into play. If you don\u2019t understand usage rights, your content can be used however the brand wants \u2014 and if you\u2019re granting a brand access to your social media channels, a lot of information is at stake.As Instagram and social media in general grows, influencers are only reaching a fraction of their audience they worked so hard to grow: this is referred to as organic reach. Naturally, when a brand is partnering with talent, they want to ensure that content is being seen by as many people as possible. This is when a brand will put additional budget to \u2018whitelist\u2019 or \u2018boost\u2019 an influencer campaign so it reaches a bigger audience. My role is to educate my clients and the brands we work with on best practices in this emerging space.I work closely with a company called Lumanu, who specialize in influencer media. They believe in a fair and transparent industry where creators deserve to know how their content, likeness, and data are being used. SocialCert provides influencers with tools that help to control what data is shared with brand partners. Influencers can manage the sharing of usage rights, such as allowing partners to use content in other channels or to boost posts. It\u2019s a brilliant company whose mission I am very aligned with. They\u2019re way ahead of the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\n(Clockwise from top left) Sumedh Chaphekar of NoFiltr, TikTok star Mrunal Panchal, veteran influencer Santoshi Shetty, the Spothlete team, Ankit Agarwal of DYT, hijabi weightlifter Majiziya Bhanu, Apaksh Gupta of One Impression and hockey player Yuvraj Walmiki \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  Hockey player Yuvraj Walmiki rose through the ranks to represent India at the 2014 World Cup. He has since fallen out of favour with selectors of the national team, but has kept busy playing for the Indian Railways and German leagues, taking part in a reality show, and being an Instagram influencer. With around 1.2 lakh followers, the 30-year-old is now a New Balance-sponsored athlete, apart from endorsing sports-related gear like Noise Shots Bluetooth headphones and a nutrition brand.But you can\u2019t put it all down to Walmiki\u2019s popularity. That credit goes to the Pune-based team at influencer marketing platform, Spothlete. Since the influencer boom in 2015, the task of these platforms has evolved from merely connecting brands with influencers (to help reach their target audience), to discussing content and creating strategies for how influencers approach their work. \u201cWe direct them on how to best present the brand in a creative way, both visually and with the accompanying content,\u201d says co-founder Prateek Goyal.\n\n\n\n\n\n The influencer economy, especially in India, is in the midst of a flux. Social media platforms are constantly tweaking their algorithms to decide the type of content they assume consumers want to see (although, all we want is the chronological timeline on Instagram back!). Brands are also looking at a shared ethos, engagements over number of likes, and quality of content over quantity of followers. So macro and micro influencers need to stand out in a crowded playing field.These are the services that influencer marketing platforms are extending. The focus is on helping the new wave of influencers (especially from tier 2 and tier 3 cities), with the basics of marketing themselves. For instance, YouTuber Angry Prash\u2019s strategy was tweaked when he signed up with Mumbai-based NoFiltr. In 2017, he\u2019d started a rant channel featuring comics made on MS Paint. Within a couple of months, he got 50,000 subscribers. \u201cAt around 1 lakh subscribers, I signed up with NoFiltr. After strategising, we decided to take things offline to engage with the audience more. I also introduced my [now signature] bird-shaped helmet to maintain my anonymity,\u201d says the 23-year-old, who presently clocks in at 3.1 million subscribers on YouTube, and has worked with Tinder, SkillShare and Amazon, among other brands.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Sumedh Chaphekar says he looks at NoFiltr as a human incubator of sorts. \u201cWe find early-stage influencers \u2014 someone who has managed around 10,000+ followers. It means they are on to something, and are ready to put in the work,\u201d he says. Once they are signed on (at no charge), they undergo an intensive planning session. \u201cWe cover everything from childhood experience to current aspirations, and then paint a roadmap that draws from these narratives and amplifies their character,\u201d he says. A strategy is created for every platform. Do HNIs (high networth individuals) approach them, to help them build up a following? Chaphekar says yes, but they don\u2019t take such projects on. Tech can often be overwhelming for potential influencers. So, not only do these platforms break down personal analytics \u2014 to show which age group or location is working for them \u2014 but they also use data and artificial intelligence tools to make content. At Chtrbox, CEO-co-founder Pranay Swarup says, \u201cWe analyse the public content of over three lakh Indian influencers and, based on this, come up with campaigns.\u201dAll the platforms featured in this article have built their own analytical software in-house, and rely on them for a host of decisions. But in August, Chtrbox went public with their data, with the launch of Boombox, an open discovery tool of India\u2019s most influential voices. This is meant to help marketers shortlist relevant celebrities in an easier, more informed manner, even if they are not clients. So, if a brand is looking to collaborate on Instagram with a stand-up comic, they\u2019ll find that Kapil Sharma has the highest reach at 18 million, but only a 2.79% engagement rate. Whereas Beast Boy Shub \u2014 a 22-year-old who puts a humorous spin on gaming \u2014 has a massive engagement rate of 32.07% with a reach of 72,600. Brands can take a call on whom to work with based on what they want out of the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platforms don\u2019t charge influencers for coming on board; most take a percentage of the brand\u2019s commission. For example, at One Impression, the team matches registered influencers with potential clients, and the platform gets a 10% commission on the completed project. \u201cWe create content at scale, mapping the influencers\u2019 audience with the brand\u2019s target audience,\u201d says founder-CEO Apaksh Gupta, adding that they screen their clients, looking at engagement rates and who they\u2019ve worked with in the past.Ankit Agarwal\u2019s three-month-old app-based platform, Do Your Thng (DYT), takes a slightly different approach. \u201cWe work even with those who have smaller followings, as long as they are willing to create content. Based on the campaigns, we connect their creations to the appropriate brands,\u201d he says. Guidelines, deliverables and mandatory hashtags are supplied, and selected content is awarded credits that can be redeemed as cash. The platform is also the official media partner for the ongoing InfluencerCon in Hyderabad, which he sees as an opportunity to grow their numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile lifestyle, fashion, travel, tech and food are the leading topics, sports influencers are the fastest growing category. And we\u2019re not talking just big names like cricketer Virat Kohli or badminton star Saina Nehwal. On a platform like Spothlethe, you will find hijabi weightlifter Majiziya Bhanu, three-time Deaflympic gold medallist Virender Singh, and national road racing and rally champion Aishwarya Pissay. They have a dedicated audience that is interested in the sport, and, as Goyal puts it, \u201cThe engagement rates can be as high as 20%.\u201d Keep in mind, this rate is around 4.42% for Kohli and 4.38% for Nehwal.Founder of the platform, Piyush Sharma, was a budding cricketer who made it to the Ranji team, but discontinued the game. He met Goyal at IIT Kanpur and the two went on to launch a site called KreedOn, dedicated to stories of Indian sportspersons. \u201cSpothlete was a natural extension of this,\u201d says Goyal. \u201cThese athletes were anyway posting images and videos based on their sport. So why not monetise it? We help curate the content and captions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past year, there have been grim tidings for this economy. Media reports indicate that a certain disdain has crept into conversations around influencers, with their authenticity often being called into question. Business Insider reported how Instagrammers are scamming followers by flaunting wealth they didn\u2019t have. In August, BBC described the furore around a biking influencer\u2019s post on being involved in an accident, which later turned out to be staged.Governments are taking note, setting in place disclosure guidelines to ensure that posts are accompanied by #sponsored or #ad. As for the popularity charts, Facebook and Instagram are rolling out plans to hide the overall number of likes, to reduce the importance given to these stats. The platforms state that the latter won\u2019t affect the marketing side of things because creators can still access their analytics. As for the bigger picture, Chaphekar says the worst-case scenario for them would be that their star clients get big enough to hire their own teams. He adds that there will always be newer platforms and newer influencers \u2014 \u201cIt is a constantly evolving space, and to survive, both we and the influencers have to be willing to do what it takes to stay relevant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWhy people are glued to their phones watching video after video on YouTube\n\n",
      "Updated: November 23, 2019 21:17 IST\rPublished: November 22, 2019 16:39 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/why-people-are-glued-to-their-phones-watching-video-after-video-on-youtube/article30050759.ece",
      "\nA cover of Sia\u2019s \u2018Chandelier\u2019 in the voice of Mario character Toad.\n\u00a0 As 2019 \u2014 arguably the longest year of all time \u2014 reaches its termination, it brings with it one of those riddle-like questions that people somehow get very confused about. Does the decade finish in 2019 or 2020? The majority of people have agreed amongst themselves that we\u2019re entering the last month of the 2010s, after which a new decade begins: the 20s, or the 2020s.But there\u2019s also a small, loud, and wrong minority convinced that we have another year to go. For the sake of both convenience and accuracy, I\u2019m going with the popular vote here \u2014 the decade ends in a month and a few days. It\u2019s the standard birth principle: the day you\u2019re born is not your first but your zero\u2019th birthday. The same rule applies here.Anyway, eight years ago, I chanced upon a curious little video during a YouTube spiral \u2014 where you open the website to watch one video and end up spending 13 hours on it. Called \u2018Talking Animals,\u2019 it was a series of clips from a BBC documentary. The video, parts of which still exist on the Internet, was basically just a collection of different animals doing their thing in the wild, with an English voice-over adding uproarious dialogues and a narrative to the seemingly random actions on screen. It was possibly the funniest thing I saw that year, and for many years after.Then, a couple of weeks ago, I found a YouTube video of a musician covering a song by Australian singer Sia, called \u2018Chandelier\u2019. So far, so ho-hum. Except that it\u2019s sung in the toddlerish, helium-inflected voice of a Mario character called Toad. It\u2019s a toad singing! And it is out of this world. I dare you to not crack up till you have tears flying off your face when the high-pitched chorus hits.This is really what YouTube is. It\u2019s memorable in the most outlandish of ways. Over the past few years, video (and audio) streaming platforms have taken over our consciousness. Netflix (and pirated streaming websites that keep changing their URL) opened the floodgates, and now we have a range of others as well, each with its own splendid collection ranging from trashy TV to water-cooler documentaries to artsy-fartsy cinema. But like Tendulkar refusing to retire for all those years, YouTube persists. It entered our lives some 15 years ago, but \u2014 in India, especially \u2014 it\u2019s only over the last few years, since the now-erstwhile telecom boom, that it\u2019s caught our fancy in a big enough way. The fact that it still has a free version and comes pre-installed in most smartphones helps a great deal, tilting the balance in its favour.Walk into the real world on any given day \u2014 maybe take the metro or a local bus \u2014 and people of all shapes are glued to their phones watching free video after free video on YouTube. My nephew watches cartoons on it, my parents use it for cooking recipes, I watch on loop that video of two Indians cursing each other loudly in broken English on a foreign street before parting ways with a kind greeting and wave.I have found new albums uploaded under false names a day before their actual release, sped up to 1.5 times the actual speed, which you then slow down and listen to. I\u2019ve watched live, newsy events. Entire pirated movies. Live concerts from before cameras were invented. Grainy footage of historic sporting events. Premieres of songs and music videos. Meme videos and comedy. Literally anything you can think of already exists on YouTube in video form. And let\u2019s not forget that it also has the most entertaining comments section of the entire Internet.Arguably, then, despite all the new stuff we\u2019ve managed to accumulate in the \u201910s, YouTube remains top dog. It\u2019s not without its problems, of course. It used to have an infuriating compulsory autoplay feature for years before it was belatedly made optional, and the absence of background playing in the free version has been a bone of contention for me for years. In the U.S., YouTube also has a white nationalist problem. And then there\u2019s the fact that YouTube is owned by the same evil corporation that owns my behind, your behind, possibly even Zuckerberg\u2019s behind. Google. But on and on it saunters. That\u2019s just the dystopia we live in.The author and freelance culture writer from New Delhi wishes he\u2019d studied engineering instead.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRed Pierrot \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nTheivaprakasham Hari  \u201cIt\u2019s a mini-encyclopedia on butterflies,\u201d declares Theivaprakasham Hari. He is talking of Butterfly Vision, his newly-launched web app that helps you identify over 300 butterflies of the Western Ghats. \u201cYou can upload any image of a butterfly and get an immediate reply on the common name and the scientific name,\u201d says Hari. As a member of The Nature and Butterfly Society (TNBS) that works towards butterfly conservation, Hari has been butterfly- spotting for over nine years. \u201cThe present identification method is based on their morphology. For example, the wing-venation, colour, shape and wing patterns. Once you spot a butterfly, you have to note down these features and compare it with images in the books on butterflies before going online. This is time consuming and often frustrating, especially for beginners,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cOne also needs to know the name of the species before referring it to an expert to confirm its rarity. Some of my friends who have done studies on butterflies spend several months on just identifying the name which means they cut down the time spent on the field. A tool like this will help them build a qualitative and quantitative data.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nTheivaprakasham Hari \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nThe app and the butterflyUsing the app is simple. I took a picture of a black and red butterfly outside my home and uploaded the image on the app. In an instant, I learnt that it was a Crimson RoseTo know more, visit https://butterflyvision.in/It is a free download and Hari says it is a work in progress. As the butterfly spottings increase, they will be added to the data Hari collated the butterfly images and his engineering skills to develop the web application. \u201cThe images have been uploaded after several rounds of verification to ensure that they are accurate. Species like the Common Crow, King Crow and Double-branded Crow look similar. So do the One Spot Grass Yellow, Common Grass Yellow and Three Spot Grass Yellow. For someone starting out, they simply look like yellow butterflies!The app helps them identify them correctly.\u201d Even in urban areas, one can see butterflies. \u201cSmall butterflies like Gram Blue and Pea Blue flutter around right in our neighbourhood. You just have to click a photograph and use the app to identify them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Four Ring \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nTheivaprakasham Hari  \n\n\n\n\nSo far, 5000 people have downloaded the Butterfly Vision app. Hari plans to develop a similar one for dragonflies, damselflies, spiders, bugs and birds. \u201cI have added images of some of the rare butterflies like the Nilgiris Grass Yellow which we spotted recently at Tirunelveli. I plan to add a description for every butterfly along with the images shortly.\u201dFrom a conservation point of view, butterfly species identification has been a challenge, says Hari. \u201cIt is important to monitor wildlife population and diversity analysis. The app will help not just the common man but also environmentalists, scientists, conservationists and those in the academic field. It builds awareness and creates interest in butterfly documentation and conservation.\u201dNext time, when you spot a pale blue butterfly.

      "\nSecurity researchers have identified that camera in Google Pixel smartphones can easily spy on you\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Google has announced to pay $1 million as top award to security researchers who can find a unique bug in its Pixel series of smartphones that may compromise users\u2019 data.There is an additional 50 per cent bonus if a security researcher is able to find an exploit on \u201cspecific developer preview versions of Android\u201d, resulting in a prize of $1.5 million.The Google Bug Bounty programme will reward the top prize to someone who can break into Google\u2019s Titan M \u201csecure element.\u201dSimilar to Apple\u2019s iPhone Secure Elementa, Titan M is a security chip that automatically scans hackers trying to load malware when an Android phone is turned on.For the new reward category, Google is looking for \u201cfull chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices.\u201d\u201cWe will reward extra for a full exploit chain (typically multiple vulnerabilities chained together) that demonstrates arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or a lockscreen bypass,\u201d said Google.When Google first introduced its bug bounty programme for Android, the biggest bug bounty reward was $38,000. Security researchers this week identified that camera in Google Pixel smartphones can easily spy on you.According to Erez Yalon and Pedro Umbelino, security researchers at cyber security firm Checkmarx, they found that vulnerabilities impact the camera apps of smartphone vendors like Google Pixel and some Samsung devices in the Android ecosystem, presenting significant implications to hundreds-of-millions of smartphone users.After a detailed analysis of the Google Camera app, the team found that by manipulating specific actions and intents, an attacker can control the app to take photos and/or record videos through a rogue application that has no permissions to do so.Google has now matched Apple in rewarding bug hunters.Apple is planning to supply special iPhones to security researchers to help them tackle malicious hackers before they trespass or damage systems and to discover flaws and vulnerabilities better.Researchers with a security research track record of high-quality systems on any platform are eligible to apply and they could end up earning a maximum payout of $1 million.Apple launched its bug bounty programme three years ago at the Black Hat conference and is now extending its use to cover macOS, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and more.Software giant Microsoft has also announced its Azure Security Lab, intended to give experts a sandbox-like safe environment to test its Cloud security services better. The company also doubled the top Azure bug bounty reward for researchers to $40,000.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe feature is not the equivalent of a delete button, but hides replies behind an icon\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Twitter has finally rolled out its \u2018Hide Replies\u2019 feature globally, which lets users hide replies they think are irrelevant, off-topic, or annoying and are changing the course of the discussion on the platform.The option to hide replies that may be offensive, hateful or racist in nature has rolled out globally on iOS, Android, Twitter Lite and twitter.com, the micro-blogging platform said in a statement on Thursday.\u201cTo give you more control over the conversations you start, we tested the option for you to hide replies to your Tweets. We learned that the feature is a useful new way to manage your conversations. Today, we\u2019re making this available to everyone globally,\u201d said Twitter.Here\u2019s how it works. Anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets. Everyone can see and engage with hidden replies by tapping the grey icon that will appear on the Tweets.This way, users will have more control over the conversations they start but people can still see the entire conversation. It is not the equivalent of a delete button, but hides replies behind an icon. If your followers still want to see the hidden replies, they can press the icon and view those.A Twitter user can also hide replies that attempt to correct misinformation or offer a fact check. The feature was first tested in Canada in July, then in the US and Japan this September.In Canada, 27 per cent of people who had their Tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future. Also, they thought it was a helpful way to manage what they saw, similar to muted keywords.\u201cSome people mentioned that they didn\u2019t want to hide replies due to fear of retaliation as the icon remains visible. We\u2019ll continue to get feedback on this,\u201d said Twitter.The company said it was also working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces.It will soon launch a new \u2018hide replies endpoint\u2019 so developers can build additional conversation management tools.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Roughly half of those or one quarter of the total had been approved and the rest denied.It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to Huawei, which is the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker and second-largest smartphone maker. A person familiar with the process said Wednesday that some licenses for sales of cellphone components and non-electronic components were approved.Microsoft declined to comment beyond its statement on which products had been approved, and the Commerce Department declined to comment.Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the license was most likely for the company\u2019s Windows operating system.\u201cThis will be a major relief for Huawei after an arduous period with large technology players like Microsoft, Google and others restricted on the platform,\u201d Ives said.Huawei has been anxiously awaiting a licence for Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Without access to Google services such as its Play Store for apps, Huawei phones will become harder to sell to consumers outside of China. Google declined to comment on Thursday.The granting of licenses comes as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth.But the move immediately met with opposition. A bipartisan group of 15 senators urged the Commerce Department to suspend the issuing of licenses, saying it could threaten U.S. security.In a letter on Thursday to Trump, the senators said the administration should halt issuing licenses until it provides Congress \u201ca report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nTesla unveils first-ever electric pickup truck\n\n",
      "Updated: November 22, 2019 10:59 IST\rPublished: November 22, 2019 10:24 IST",

      "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla's design studio on Thursday, November 21, 2019, in Hawthorne, California. Musk is taking on the workhorse heavy pickup truck market with his latest electric vehicle. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: AP  Tesla Inc on Thursday unveiled its first pickup truck, delivering on a promise by Chief Executive Elon Musk to build an electric version of America's favourite vehicle and one that threatens the heart of Detroit automakers' profits.At a launch event in Los Angeles, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said the truck, which looked liked a futuristic armoured vehicle, will have a starting price of $39,900 and a maximum range of 500 plus miles.\u201cWe need sustainable energy now. If we don't have a pickup truck we can't solve it. The top 3 selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks. To solve sustainable energy, we have to have a pickup truck,\u201d he said.Production is expected to begin in late 2021.Mr. Musk earlier tweeted the design was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s 007 film The Spy Who Loved Me.The truck marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan is the world's top-selling battery electric car, into pickup trucks, a market dominated by Ford Motor Co's F-150, along with models by General Motors Co, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV .The pickup shifts Tesla more toward trucks and SUVs. The automaker has so far sold mostly Model S and Model 3 sedans, but also offers the Model X SUV and starting next year the Model Y compact SUV.A focus on the high-performance end of the market is only natural given the success of Ford's 450-horsepower F-150 Raptor truck, which launched in 2009 and whose sales have since risen annually, according to Ford spokesman Mike Levine.While Ford does not disclose Raptor sales, Levine said annual demand is well above 19,000 vehicles and the No. 2 U.S. automaker has never had to offer incentives on the model, which costs in the high $60,000 range. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup.Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups.Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states.The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment \u2014 both full and mid-sized models \u2014 will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\nThe bot is designed with novel \u201cdeductive reasoning\u201d added into an AI algorithm commonly used for playing poker\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n Researchers have developed an artificial intelligence-enabled machine that can beat human players in a tricky online multiplayer game where player roles and motives are kept secret, says a study. It was presented at International Conference on Information Systems.The machine, called \u2018DeepRole\u2019, is the first gaming bot that can win online multiplayer games in which the participants\u2019 team allegiances are initially unclear, according the study from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US.The bot is designed with novel \u201cdeductive reasoning\u201d added into an AI algorithm commonly used for playing poker. This helps it reason about partially observable actions, to determine the probability that a given player is a teammate or opponent. In doing so, it quickly learns whom to ally with and which actions to take to ensure its team\u2019s victory.\u201cIf you replace a human teammate with a bot, you can expect a higher win rate for your team. Bots are better partners,\u201d said study first author Jack Serrino from MIT.The researchers pitted DeepRole against human players in more than 4,000 rounds of the online game The Resistance: Avalon. In this game, players try to deduce their peers\u2019 secret roles as the game progresses, while simultaneously hiding their own roles. As both a teammate and an opponent, DeepRole consistently outperformed human players. \u201cHumans learn from and cooperate with others, and that enables us to achieve together things that none of us can achieve alone,\u201d said study co-author Max Kleiman\u2014Weiner.\u201cGames like Avalon better mimic the dynamic social settings humans experience in everyday life. You have to figure out who\u2019s on your team and will work with you, whether it\u2019s your first day of kindergarten or another day in your office,\u201d Kleiman-Weiners said. The bot is trained by playing against itself as both resistance and spy. When playing an online game, it uses its game tree to estimate what each player is going to do.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIt was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n The Trump administration on Wednesday gave Huawei its second reprieve this week, allowing some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant after it was placed on a trade black list over national security concerns six months ago.The Commerce Department said it has begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company\u2019s supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods.It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker. But Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, also the second-largest smartphone maker, has been anxiously awaiting a license for Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Google declined to comment.A U.S. official said of roughly 300 license requests, about half have been processed. Roughly half of those or one quarter of the total have been approved and the rest have been denied.A different person familiar with the process added that some licenses for sales of cell phone components and non-electronic components were approved.\u201cThe Department is issuing these narrow licenses to authorise limited and specific activities that do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement, without providing further detail.The move came after the Commerce Department renewed the so-called temporary general license for the company for a third time on Monday, extending permission for Huawei to engage in limited transactions to assist U.S. rural network operators.The goodwill gestures come as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth.Many China hawks have voiced fears that the administration could relax sanctions on Huawei to appease Beijing and score a win on trade.Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement the company \u201cposes a clear and growing threat to the economic and national security\u201d of the United States and its allies.\u201cI strongly believe it\u2019s against America\u2019s national security interest to grant licenses for U.S exports that sustain or strengthen Huawei,\u201d he said, adding that the Commerce Department should inform lawmakers of what licenses were given.But the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, welcomed the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, saying sales of the non-sensitive items help ensure the competitiveness of U.S. chipmakers, \u201cwhich is essential to national security.\u201d\u201cWe hope license approvals continue to proceed in an appropriate and timely manner,\u201d the group added.The United States has pending cases against Huawei for allegedly stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. The administration has also lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei denied the allegations.The Trump administration put Huawei on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns in May after trade talks broke down. Companies on the list are not allowed to receive shipments of U.S. goods without a special license from the Commerce Department.But in June, U.S. President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed to the company, and U.S. officials urged firms to apply for licenses, noting that they would be granted in cases where the items were readily available and did not compromise national security.But until Wednesday, there had been no responses on the license requests.Despite the good news, plenty of headwinds remain for Huawei, which is still awaiting rules from the Commerce Department that are expected to bar them from the U.S. telecoms network.\u201cThe White House isn\u2019t ready to pull the plug on Huawei because that would do almost as much harm to U.S. companies,\u201d said James Lewis, a technology expert with the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cBut they\u2019re keeping it in reserve,\u201d he added.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-bars-elections-ads-from-using-political-leanings-voter-data/article30034474.ece",
      "Alphabet Inc's Google will stop giving advertisers the ability to target election ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations, the company said in a blog post on November 20.The move coincides with pressure on social media platforms over their handling of political advertising ahead of the U.S. presidential election in 2020.Google said it would limit audience targeting for election ads to age, gender and general location at a postal code level. Political advertisers also can still contextually target, such as serving ads to people reading about a certain topic.Previously, verified political advertisers could also target ads using data gleaned from users' behavior, such as search actions, that categorized them as left-leaning, right-leaning or independent. They could also upload data such as voter file lists to target ads to a lookalike audience which exhibited similar behaviors to those in the data.Google will enforce the new approach in the United Kingdom within a week, ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. Google said it would enforce it in the European Union by the end of the year and in the rest of the world starting on Jan. 6, 2020.\u201cGiven recent concerns and debates about political advertising, and the importance of shared trust in the democratic process, we want to improve voters' confidence in the political ads they may see on our ad platforms,\u201d Scott Spencer, vice president of product management for Google Ads, said in the blog post.The changes are expected to prompt political campaigns to shift some ads to television and Google's smaller rivals. Tim Cameron, chief executive of FlexPoint Media, which buys ads for Republican campaigns, said he will stop licensing Google's ad-buying tool in January because of the new restrictions.The voter file feature had enabled FlexPoint to target people who did not regularly cast a ballot and encourage them to turn out. The loss of such targeting could result in \u201ca slow decline of civic participation\u201d and hurt the ability of \u201dinsurgent, underfunded candidates\u201d to gain support, Cameron said.Google also added examples to its misrepresentation policy to show that it would not allow false claims about election results or the eligibility of political candidates based on age or birthplace.Last month, Google refused to remove an ad run by President Donald Trump's re-election campaign on its YouTube video-streaming service that Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden's campaign said contained false claims, because it did not violate the policy.A Google spokeswoman told Reuters on November 20 that the video would still be allowed under the latest policy. Google also clarified that its policies for political and nonpolitical ads prohibit doctored and manipulated media.On Dec. 3, the company will expand its ad transparency efforts to ads related to state-level elections, including them in an online database created to catalog political advertising.Twitter Inc has banned political ads, while Facebook Inc is reviewing its policies after criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Supriya Paul, co-founder of Josh Talks, adds, \u201cWe want to further stress on the importance of skills so that people can create livelihoods for themselves.\u201d Like Momin, other beneficiaries of NSDC\u2019s skill development programmes will record motivational videos for the online platform. The series will also feature past winners of the biennial event that is centred around vocational efficiency. \u201cShowcasing these stories are important as a perception building activity for our viewers,\u201d stresses Paul. As of now, Josh Talks engages a non-English speaking audience from tier 2 and 3 cities, through videos and other online content in regional languages. While the NSDC hopes to tap into this repository to further their programmes, Josh Talks hopes to gain access to a larger audience for their recently-launched skill training courses. The organisations will co-create vocational courses which will be available on NSDC\u2019s website. These include necessary soft skills like personality development, confidence building, English language, job interview preparation and resume building courses. In the long term, Josh Talks aims at hosting real-time, offline round table conferences that will showcase these achievers, while engaging people from other digital platforms, civil society organisations, content creators and policy makers from relevant government ministries. \u201cThe goal is to get more e-learning platforms involved to create content that\u2019s more relevant to our kind of target audience,\u201d concludes Paul.

We have made this decision based on our belief that political message reach should be earned, not bought,\u201d the micro-blogging platform said on Friday.On October 31, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had tweeted: \u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly either.\u201dThe company argues the decision to \u201cadd Huawei to the Entity List has caused more harm to the US than to Huawei. This has done significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business.\u201dIn May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was directed to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.The Commerce Department is also considering whether to grant individual licenses for U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei after receiving more than 200 requests. No action on those was taken on Monday.The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) returns to launching its operational satellites this month after a hiatus of six months.Cartosat-3, an advanced earth imaging and mapping satellite, will be flown on November 25 on the PSLV-C47 vehicle, subject to weather conditions, the space agency announced on Monday.The 1,560 kg satellite will have 13 small U.S. customer satellites riding as secondary passengers. They will be placed in a polar orbit.Although ISRO sent up Chandrayaan 2, the lunar orbiter probe, in July, its previous functional satellite was RISAT-2B, launched in May.Cartosat-3, with an ISRO-best resolution of 25 cm, will be the first of a series of high resolution, third generation satellites planned for observing the Earth. The satellite will be able to pick up objects of that size (25 cm) from its orbital perch about 509 km away. This will make Cartosat-3 among the few sharpest civil earth imagers worldwide.Previously, the Cartosat-2 second generation series offered the best resolution of 65 cm from ISRO. The agency entered the sub-metre (80 cm) resolution club in 2007 with Cartosat-2, the best civil imagery resolution of that time.Much of such high resolution imageries are used exclusively by the Armed Forces.\u201cPSLV-C47 will launch Cartosat-3 and 13 commercial nanosatellites into a sun synchronous orbit from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The launch is tentatively scheduled at 9.28 a.m. IST on November 25, subject to weather conditions,\u201d ISRO said.Recently, Planet Labs, a U.S.-based earth imaging company, said 12 of its SuperDove/Flock 4p constellation of cubesats would be flown with Cartosat-3.For this mission, the PSLV is being flown in its XL, or extended version, with six added or strapped on booster rockets.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nMy souring love story with Apple\n\n",

      "\nAll Apple \u00a0 My love story began as a nodding acquaintance in the basement of a newspaper office. I would step into the small partitioned room with three men furiously tapping away on a computer with an orange keyboard and see flickering green letters come alive on the screen. A few feet away was another computer. All white, with a slot for a floppy drive, and a small rainbow-coloured half-eaten-apple as the logo. The keyboard brought alive some of the most beautiful letters on the screen. Zapf Dingbats, Garamond, Helvetica and other typefaces with their curvy elegance would get printed out in real time. I was hooked. The computer was used for printing out headlines in the newspaper office in Nagpur.Years later, when a friend visited the US of A, I asked her to get me an iPod Shuffle. I got a bright blue device that fit perfectly into the small pocket of my jeans. Loaded with my favourite songs that could be shuffled randomly with a white flywheel, it was a delight to listen to Dire Straits or Roxette (yes, I am old) while going for a jog. It was a big upgrade from a chunky MP3 player called Creative Zen that required me to use great ingenuity to switch songs. Also, the Shuffle was 10 times smaller. \u2018Life is Random\u2019 never sounded more fun.It turned into a roaring affair when I stood in the queue on the midnight of March 2, 2010 and handed out a wad of cash to get hold of the iPhone 3GS. It was curvy, it was pillowy and it responded to touch. I filed the story of the purchase for my newspaper standing outside the shop in Begumpet in Hyderabad.Apple launched MacBook Air with an Intel chip and I had it within months of its launch. Writing, reading, blogging, browsing and clicking selfies using the built-in camera was a joy. The best part, I didn\u2019t have to worry about viruses like the other folks who used four square boxes. I could even watch DVDs on the small white box of love. While Ctrl+Alt+Del was the go-to command on the office computer, on my MacBook Air, I never had to resort to such drastic actions. Then Apple launched an 11-inch MacBook Air and I had it within months. Slimmer without the outdated CD slot, it was a breeze. I was not just using the Apple products, I was an evangelist. Friends too fell in love hearing my love story.Then disaster struck. I bought an iPhone XS. Apple insisted that I use Siri. I didn\u2019t want to. Who wants someone else to be listening all the time? Even now it says, \u2018Finish setting up your iPhone\u2019. I don\u2019t want to. In May 2019, Apple launched a MacBook Pro featuring a 2.4 GHz Quad-Core processor. I switched it on and then tried to switch the language. Nothing. The keyboard was dead. I never had to hit chatrooms to find solutions for issues with my MacBook. But once I began searching for the problem, I realised I was in trouble. Big trouble. Solutions like resetting the SMC (system management controller) and resetting Parameter RAM didn\u2019t work. The keyboard stayed dead. Apparently, the butterfly keyboard had problems since its conception and I realised that many fanboys of Apple were furious. Some of them even signed a petition demanding a recall of the failed keyboard. I was ready to formalise my divorce as I walked into the Apple service centre. After testing my patience for a week, I got my MacBook Pro and it is working fine.Now, I am told the newly-launched 16-inch MacBook Pro has the older keyboard design and is more springy.Maybe I should\u2026 Should I?You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nGodfather of gaming: Hideo Kojima's incredible legacy and his latest 'Death Stranding'\n\n",
      "Updated: November 19, 2019 15:38 IST\rPublished: November 18, 2019 16:00 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hideo-kojima-and-his-evolution-and-his-relationship-with-technology/article30006560.ece",
      "\nHideo Kojima \u00a0 As we have been pulling apart the massive onion that is Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima has been having quite the week. His game has opened to critical acclaim, and just last week, on November 10, he was awarded two Guinness World Records for the \u2018most followed video game director on Twitter (36,26,300 across two accounts) and Instagram (9,71,000)\u2019 underpinning his impact on gaming and pop culture. Kojima, over the years, has garnered legions of international fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nHideo Kojima with his Guinness World Records\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in the Setagaya area of Tokyo, Japan, Kojima nurtured a love for cinema and literature through his teenage years, but faced a lot of pressure to pursue a more lucrative career. He wound up studying economics at university, during which time, he discovered video games on a Nintendo Famicom. This fuelled a switch to video game design in the fourth year of his degree.  \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0His first big break as a designer came in 1986 with Japanese entertainment conglomerate Konami\u2019s MSX home computer division. MSX is a standardised home architecture system favoured by early game developers, including Konami. This would later frustrate him due to the restrictions of technology then. Eventually, his bold visions would motivate him to innovate and create the technology that would support them.Kojima\u2019s d\u00e9but title Penguin Adventure (1986) was one of the first instances of multiple endings in a game. It also opened a door for him to take on the reins of the Metal Gear franchise \u2014 which not only introduced Solid Snake to us, but was also one of the first true stealth games. His other success then came in the form of the Blade Runner-esque game called Snatcher (1988), where he first experimented with camera tilts and mature content. Kojima kept evolving this cult favourite with recorded dialogue as it transitioned to CD-ROM formats in 1992. Metal Gear Solid was unveiled at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show in Chiba, and \u2014 much like Death Stranding now \u2014 no one had experienced anything quite like it, for its complex storyline and movie quality cut-scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot from Metal Gear Solid \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNever wanting to be in one vertical, he also worked on other projects, including space-mecha-combat game Zone of the Enders, courting mild successes in rebooting vampire-based game Castlevania with Lords of Shadow. Yet, his fate was always entwined with that of the Metal Gear universe, until a radically different project.Released as a free demo in 2014, P.T. (or Playable Teaser) is a first-person psychological horror video game set in a looping hallway of jump scares. While the game did not have cut-scenes, the entire hallway sequence was structured like a playable hand-held horror movie. \u201cKojima is a true auteur of storytelling in gaming, due to his expressive ideology of human connection, his detail of game-play mechanics and underlying truth that as a species we hold responsibility to the world. Kojima is an important voice in a world of storytelling, far beyond cinema,\u201d says Amit Tida, documentary producer and shamanic gamer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot from P.T. (Playable Teaser) \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTo many gamers\u2019 delight, it was co-directed by Kojima and Guillermo del Toro, and this experience would eventually lead to a reboot of the well-known Silent Hill franchise. Sadly, things soured between Kojima and Konami, and as a result, P.T. was pulled out. Till today, those surviving P.T. demos have remained undeleted on PlayStations and players are actively experiencing new phenomenon. Prior to leaving Konami to re-form his studio, Kojima made Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Kojima Productions is entirely independent, and they with Sony unleash his full potential with Death Stranding, of which the trailer was unveiled at the E3 conference in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot from Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained his philosophy in a recent interview with Game Informer, \u201cPreviously, in design, you had to create the rule because you couldn\u2019t do the realism. In our everyday lives, there are so many mechanisms we have to work through, and we have to take the balance of what we do, how we maintain ourselves, and how we live. I wanted to free the game design concept that we had to live by because we didn\u2019t have the technology to do so in the past.\u201d Kojima is known to flagrate global anticipation prior to his creations\u2019 releases. For example, the feverish viral confusion that followed the trailer of the recent Death Stranding. Now, gamers are working hard at piecing together that one big puzzle he created. Meanwhile, Kojima has already got future plans, to get back to what got him started down this path in the first place: making films.But what about the futurist in Kojima? He is a proponent of technology, openly adapting the tech to be a conduit for his stories. If the stories in his head require Virtual Reality, he will do so. For Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, he created the Fox game engine from the ground up. With up-to-date performance capture tech, Kojima also pushes actors to the next level in the game, a trait vocally commended by Norman Reedus (who portrays Death Stranding\u2019s protagonist).\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman Reedus and Hideo Kojima, who worked on Death Stranding together\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 56-year-old is one of the first game directors to explore cinema-style cut-scenes at an early stage to support his zest for film-making. This prompted Mad Max: Fury Road director George Miller to praise his \u201ccreative courage\u201d, a trait he sees in all great film-makers. Plus, Kojima has star power on quick-dial, as seen by the all-star cast in Death Stranding, and the full support of Sony. The stage is set for the next phase of Hideo Kojima\u2019s journey and everyone has front row seats.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Google logo is displayed outside the company offices in New York, U.S. File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n  Ever-expanding Google becomes a gaming company Tuesday with the launch of its Stadia cloud service that lets people play console-quality video games on a web browser or smartphone. The Internet giant hopes to break into the global video game industry expected to top $150 billion this year, with cloud technology that could broaden audiences attracted by rich new features as well as ease of access with no more need for consoles.But analysts say Stadia\u2019s outlook is uncertain as its faces rivals such as PlayStation Now in an emerging and highly-competitive market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Stadia plays into a trend in which content \u2014 ranging from blockbuster films to work projects \u2014 lives in the cloud and is accessible from any device.\u201cAll of these new services are merely pointing out that we don\u2019t need sophisticated hardware in the home to access entertainment,\u201d said Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Michael Pachter. Google last month sold out of \u201cFounder\u2019s Edition\u201d kits, which are priced at $129.Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.Stadia games are playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers. It also works with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward, and on televisions.Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the U.S., will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe. But analysts say Stadia could wind up as another \u201cbet\u201d that Google walks away from if it fails to live up to expectations.\u201cStadia will live or die by its content,\u201d said Ovum senior analyst George Jijiashvili.\u201cThe announced 12 launch titles are underwhelming.\u201d Subscribers will be able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data-centers, but some free games will be available to subscribers, starting with \u201cDestiny 2: The Collection.\u201d Stadia on smartphones will work with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services. Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed Internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be. Some promised features such as integration with YouTube will not be in place at launch.\u201cStadia appears to be rushed out the door before fully ready and, worryingly, Google is risking falling short on its promises,\u201d Mr. Jijiashvili said. .\u201cThese shortcomings however would be easily overlooked if Google can deliver a very reliable and high-quality game streaming service.\u201d Google appears committed to doing just that, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early. The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.\u201cFrom what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested,\u201d Early said. \u201cThey are not calling it quits any time soon.\u201d He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.\u201cIf there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn\u2019t the end of the world; it isn\u2019t even close,\u201d he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.But Mr. Pachter questioned whether subscriptions were the right approach. .\u201cThe right model is pay as you go or pay for the game and play unlimited without a subscription,\u201d Mr. Pachter said.\u201cAmazon will try one of those and will win the streaming wars.\u201d Amazon has game studios but no online game service.U.S. technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform.\u201cNext year, we\u2019ll bring Project xCloud to Windows PCs, and are collaborating with a broad set of partners to make game streaming available on other devices as well,\u201d Microsoft corporate vice president Kareem Choudhry said in an online post. Sony Interactive Entertainment last month slashed the price of its PlayStation Now cloud video game service by about half in the U.S. to $10 monthly. Japan-based Sony also boosted the library of games that PlayStation Now users can access through its consoles or on personal computers powered by Windows software. Sony and Microsoft are also poised to release new-generation video game consoles next year.\u201cWhile we expect dedicated consoles to eventually lose relevance in the face of cloud gaming services, there\u2019s no guarantee that it will be Google\u2019s service \u2014 rather than Sony and Microsoft\u2019s \u2014 that catalyzes this trend,\u201d said Ovum senior analyst Matthew Bailey.

      "\nBe it a fitness tracker, smartwatch, smart speaker or smart home assistant, the way Bluetooth devices communicate with the mobile apps leaves room for hackers to steal sensitive personal information, new research has found.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Be it a fitness tracker, smartwatch, smart speaker or smart home assistant, the way Bluetooth devices communicate with the mobile apps leaves room for hackers to steal sensitive personal information, new research has found.An inherent design flaw makes mobile apps that work with Bluetooth Low Energy devices vulnerable to hacking, said the study described at the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Conference on Computer and Communications Security held in London from November 11-15.\u201cThere is a fundamental flaw that leaves these devices vulnerable \u2014 first when they are initially paired to a mobile app, and then again when they are operating,\u201d said Zhiqiang Lin, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University in the US. \u201cWhile the magnitude of that vulnerability varies, we found it to be a consistent problem among Bluetooth low energy devices when communicating with mobile apps,\u201d Lin added. Consider a wearable health and fitness tracker, smart thermostat, smart speaker or smart home assistant. Each first communicates with the apps on your mobile device by broadcasting something called a UUID \u2014 a universally unique identifier. That identifier allows the corresponding apps on your phone to recognise the Bluetooth device, creating a connection that allows your phone and device to talk to one another.But that identifier itself is also embedded into the mobile app code. Otherwise, mobile apps would not be able to recognise the device. However, such UUIDs in the mobile apps make the devices vulnerable to a fingerprinting attack, the research team found.\u201cAt a minimum, a hacker could determine whether you have a particular Bluetooth device, such as a smart speaker, at your home, by identifying whether or not your smart device is broadcasting the particular UUIDs identified from the corresponding mobile apps,\u201d Lin said.\u201cBut in some cases in which no encryption is involved or encryption is used improperly between mobile apps and devices, the attacker would be able to \u2018listen in\u2019 on your conversation and collect that data.\u201d Still, that doesn\u2019t mean you should throw your smartwatch away.\u201cWe think the problem should be relatively easy to fix, and we\u2019ve made recommendations to app developers and to Bluetooth industry groups,\u201d he said.If app developers tightened defences in that initial authentication, the problem could be resolved, Lin said.The team reported their findings to developers of vulnerable apps and to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, and created an automated tool to evaluate all of the Bluetooth Low Energy apps in the Google Play Store \u2014 18,166 at the time of their research. In addition to building the databases directly from mobile apps of the Bluetooth devices in the market, the team\u2019s evaluation also identified 1,434 vulnerable apps that allow unauthorised access. Their analysis did not include apps in the Apple Store.\u201cIt was alarming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential for privacy invasion is high.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "As an entertainment provider, you have not really cemented yourself in the 21st Century if you have not got yourself an OTT platform. Currently in India alone, there are over 30 platforms racing to break new ground in technology and innovation. We have seen Lionsgate Play, Tata Sky Binge, Voot, Zee5 make forays into the market but at the moment there remains a core group of streaming services to which we subscribe instinctively. Set-top boxes (such as those of Tata Sky, Airtel and Jio) have faced scrutiny and rejection from more millennials for the lack of prompt customer service and, of course, the fact that inter-device mobility is not as seamless as it is with a streaming service. So here, we break down each of the headline-making OTT platforms, along with technologies they may use as well as how to access them: \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecials / Originals: Fleabag, Made In Heaven, Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack RyanAdditional licensed content from NBC (Blindspot, The Office US) from ITV (Downton Abbey) and CBS (Blue Bloods, 2 Broke Girls) Rates and access: USP: With the Prime subscription, a user gets access to priority delivery of purchases made on Amazon and access to Prime Music streaming.

Hotstar is owned by Star India, which belongs to The Walt Disney Company. Along with the entire catalog of Disney+ content, many titles could be localised for the Indian market by being dubbed in various regional languages. Rates and other specifics for the Indian market are yet to be revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginals/Specials:Hasan Minhaj: Patriot Act, Sacred Games, Bojack HorsemanAdditional licensed content from NBC (Friends, The Office US, Blacklist), from ABC (How To Get Away With Murder, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Designated Survivor)Rates and access: USP: Netflix uses adaptive streaming which uses Machine Learning to recognise network conditions and adjust the video quality up or down based on that.

      "\nPicture for representative purposes only.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto As many as 265 fake local news websites in more that 65 countries, including the US, Canada, Brussels and Geneva, are managed by Indian influence networks with the aim of influencing international institutions along with elected representatives and swaying the public perception of Pakistan, a study by NGO EU DisinfoLab has found.Most of these websites, the study found, were named after an extinct local newspaper or spoof real media outlets and republish content from several news agencies such as KCNA, Voice of America and Interfax. Some of these are themirrorofaustralia.com, thetimesofceylon.com, thehoovergazette.com, theseattlestar.com, miamivalleychannel.com, timesofgeneva.com and the dublingazette.com.Additionally, these sites provided coverage of the same Indian-related demonstrations and events and republications of anti-Pakistan content from the Indian influence network.Pointing out that most these websites have a Twitter account as well, EU DisinfoLab found that these fake media outlets were formed to \u201cinfluence international institutions and elected representatives with coverage of specific events and demonstrations; provide NGOs with useful press material to reinforce their credibility and thus be impactful as well as influence public perceptions on Pakistan by multiplying iterations of the same content available on search engines.\u201dFurther, it said that with several layers of media outlets that quote and republish one another, it was harder for the reader to trace the manipulation, and in turn (sometimes) offered a \u201cmirage\u201d of international support.The EU DisinfoLab said that in October, European External Action Service\u2019s East StratCom -- the EU Disinformation Task Force, had found that \u2018eptoday.com\u2019 \u2013 website of a self-proclaimed magazine for the European Parliament in Brussels, had been re-publishing a large amount of news directly from Russia Today and Voice of America. \u201cAmong this syndicated content, we unexpectedly found a large number of articles and op-eds related to minorities in Pakistan as well as other India-related matters.\u201dIt was then discovered that EP Today was managed by Indian stakeholders with ties to a large network of think tanks, NGOs, and companies from the Srivastava Group. \u201cWe also found that the IP address of the Srivastava Group is also home to the obscure online media \u2018New Delhi Times\u2019 and the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies (IINS), which are all based at the same address in New Delhi, India.\u201dA few weeks later, 27 Members of the European Parliament were invited by IINS to visit Kashmir and to meet with Prime Minister Modi.On further investigation, the EU DisinfoLab found that timesofgeneva.com \u2013 an online \u201cnewspaper\u201d that is \u201capproaching 35 years in business\u201d, has the same content as EP Today and produces videos covering events and demonstrations criticising Pakistan\u2019s role in the Kashmir conflict.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "An inconspicuous apartment, three storeys above and off busy Sardar Patel Road in Adyar, is where this scene unfolds. Nothing major, we are here to eat food. Except, there is no chef or cook involved; our dinner will be prepared by automated technology.\u201cWe have pre-programmed nearly 600 dishes into it,\u201d says Saravanan Sundaramoorthy, CEO and founder, Robochef. The \u201cit\u201d he is referring to is not a humanoid, walking and talking \u2014 \u201cI have seen it in the film Enthiran\u201d \u2014 type robot. Robochef is a massive stainless steel structure, which looks like unwieldy kitchen equipment with very little visually pleasing detail.Inside Robochef, moving belts that carry utensils, and containers that deliver spices and vegetables into the main cooking vessel, are operated by sensors tuned using computer codes.We watch one of the machines cook kesari. After a helper loads the machine with rava, sugar and other ingredients necessary for the dish, a tap of a button on a computer initiates the frying process. Soon, the steel utensil carrying ghee unloads it into the main cooking vessel, and the in-built automated twin-headed spatula starts stirring the mixture until it attains the required thickness. In a few minutes, dessert is ready. \u201cRobochef stands out because there is no need for human intervention at any stage after raw ingredients are loaded into the machine. You don\u2019t even need to chop the vegetables or worry about cleaning it,\u201d claims Saravanan.His team simultaneously cooks seeraga samba chicken biryani and chicken curry. He offers us a plate. It tastes exactly the same as the order from your neighbourhood biryani stall.However, nuances associated to idiosyncratic cooking styles attributed to human intelligence can be found wanting in automated cooking. Robochef is currently a ghost kitchen (a kitchen set up for preparing delivery-only meals). \u201cWe have tied up with caterers who supply in bulk to events and hotels. Our product has helped them improve their gains, and takes out the dependency on a cook,\u201d says Saravanan.There are two variants of the machine that Saravanan has built \u2014 the commercial variant that he sells for \u20b945 lakh, meant for commercial ghost kitchens, and the domestic variant that he has priced at \u20b96 lakh, which, he adds, has already found a few customers. He says the warranty for the first year is included in the price. The numbers he puts forward are mind-boggling. He claims that he can supply an item, for instance, seeraga samba chicken biriyani (which retails upwards of \u20b9130) for as little as \u20b960. \u201cI would still stand to make a handsome profit margin on these numbers,\u201d he adds. Which is why he has an ambitious plan of entering the restaurant business himself, with this technology. \u201cThere is no point in licensing or selling this concept to an established restaurant chain,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, I intend to start a franchisee business under Robochef\u2019s brand identity.\u201d Watch this space.

      "\n\nExplore limitless gaming with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Kojima\u2019s Death Stranding\n\n",

      "\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n 2019 presented some pretty impressive games which broke ground, tech-wise. While Call Of Duty rarely disappoints in the realm of first-person shooter, Death Stranding has been garnering more curiosity for its mysterious plotline and star-studded cast and crew. Babies in pods, mysterious handprints and a whole cast of characters with strange names like Die-Hardman. Death Stranding has weaved an intricate cobweb of curiosity around it with legendary game designer Hideo Kojima directing that chaos. Now that it\u2019s out, we finally know what it is about, sort of.You assume the role of a sci-fi delivery guy named Sam Porter Bridges, played by Normal Reedus, who is tasked with delivering parcels across a post-apocalyptic America in the hope of reconnecting everything. It is very hard to categorise Death Stranding, as it skews several game genres and creates something completely different. One thing is clear though \u2014 the story is excellent, in acting, pacing and it has Kojima\u2019s hallmark style throughout. Which means that it is long, drawn-out and takes it time in telling.Death StrandingDeveloper: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: SonyPrice: \u20b93999 for the PlayStation 4Much like the Jenga tower of parcels Sam has to lug around, the game strives hard to balance all its ideas into something coherent while trying to be different. Most of the game is a brutal slog, as you have to manually sort of balance your load on harsh terrain. For any mistake will send you on an even worse slog of recovering your lost loot. Just as you are about to tear your hair out a few hours into the game, things get good, as you\u2019re connected to the Chiral Network. Which allows you to traverse the realm with ease, using ladders and the like to help other players as well as let them help you.Encounters with beached things (BT), the invisible monsters, are tense and the best parts of the game, which explains the Bridge Baby or BB. A bridge to the realm of the dead that notifies you of these entities. There is an Aliens-like motion detector quality of these sequences as you sneak past the BTs until you get the means to kill them later. There are human enemies too, whom you can get creative in dealing with, like with grenades made out of your body waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangment\n \n\n\n\n\nDespite the slog, the game is engaging, making each delivery feel like it counts, even though they\u2019re fetch quests. Except to get to the good parts you will need to trudge through the tedious inventory management and uneven traversal. Recommended if you are feeling brave and want to try something different or if you are a die-hard Kojima fan.Mid-campaign, a young sergeant asks a pointed question \u2018where do we draw the line?\u2019. We always look at lives of soldiers and covert operatives with James Bond-like views, when these are the people who have to make the hard choices, often knee-deep in the dirt. That line gets thinner as Modern Warfare touches on the vicious circle of a fight against terrorism where the line blurs between good guy and bad guy. One man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.Call of Duty: Modern WarfareDeveloper: Infinity WardPublisher: ActivisionPrice: \u20b94699 PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCYou play Modern Warfare from two different perspectives. Alex, a covert CIA operative\u2019s search for a stolen shipment of deadly gas canisters, leads him to working with Urzikstan\u2019s rebel force led by Farah Karim, to free the country from a rogue Russian general who believes he is eradicating terrorists. Meanwhile, Sergeant Kyle with Captain Price are sent Alex and Farah\u2019s way after a suicide bombing in London.The campaign is edge-of-the-seat, with every second carrying a payload of the palpable tension of a summer blockbuster. Expertly weaving you from claustrophobic close quarters, where you have to choose your targets wisely, to massive war sequences around the globe. Letting you play as a seasoned solider in a clandestine war, as well as a kid in the midst of a chemical attack, the game takes some bold steps in its narrative, with a handful of memorable moments that will hit you hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty has always been tight with the combat, distilled over years of perfecting its formula. The gun play is tight as expected and it keeps things fresh by letting you try out different weapons. You also get a chance to control drones, call in air strikes and even control explosive-laden RC Planes.The game engine looks incredible, especially in rendering the battlefield devastation realism. From twitching bodies of dying people to animals struggling with their breath, the game portrays the horrors of war. The game is plagued by bad cut-scene frame rates and crashes, even though the game-play is smooth. Which is a shame because the cut-scenes are beautifully rendered.It is very rare when a reboot is a lot better than the original and Modern Warfare paints a compelling story with gun smoke and blood. Highly recommended, with a campaign that you will remember for years to come.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "While returning from a trip, early one morning, with his wife and five-year-old son in Balangir last April, Kuldeep Pattnaik\u2019s car fractionally missed a speeding lorry. \u201cAnything could have happened that day,\u201d he says. One of the first things that came to his mind, then, was his son\u2019s education. \u201cI am from a small district in Odisha. What I had learnt in Odiya is what my son was learning at school in English. Nothing much has changed. And, that moment I realised that I wanted to give my son the best platform to learn.\u201dKuldeep, a digital entrepreneur, decided to home-school his son, Venkat Raman. He had an inkling that Venkat would engage with software. So when he chanced upon a Facebook advertisement in March for WhiteHat Jr\u2019s coding classes, he signed him up for it.\u201cIt was difficult in the beginning,\u201d says Venkat, who was introduced to concepts such as commands, sequences and code structure. \u201cA few weeks later, I started liking it.\u201dKaran Bajaj, the founder of WhiteHat Jr, says there are over 100 apps already on Google\u2019s Play Store created by students who use his platform.Karan, the former CEO of Discovery India Network, started WhiteHat Jr in November last year to enable young people to create, rather than merely consume, technology. The live online coding classes help children aged six to 14 to design games, animations and apps. The startup claims to have over 500 teachers, conducting 1000-plus online classes every day.Mumbai\u2019s Hirranya Rajani, 7, has developed an application to help those with hearing impairment. When a user enters a word, the app shows the finger spelling for each letter in the word. \u201cMy brother always has to use a wheelchair. I wanted to help people like him in a way,\u201d she says. But Hirranya was intrigued by sign language. Hence, when she took up coding, she knew what she wanted to create.Vihaan Khera, 9, from Gurugram, is a bookworm. His app Book Barter, which is soon to be released on Play Store, is a platform for meeting fellow readers and exchanging books. \u201cIt will provide access to more books to all. Exchanging the books will not only save money, but will also save the environment,\u201d he says.WhiteHat Jr apart, there are avenues aplenty for young people in India to learn coding. CodingZen, based in New Delhi, offers courses for children, aged five to 14, and adults. Noida-based Qin1 offers spoken English classes apart from coding. Many of the teachers these companies employ are from reputed institutions such as the Indian Institute of Technology. With digital addiction fast becoming a common problem, should a parent exercise caution before enrolling their child in these online classes?\u201cOf course, too much of anything is bad,\u201d says Qin1\u2019s co-founder Ishan Gupta. \u201cWe live, however, in an age where children are exposed to technology. The question is: \u2018how to make it constructive?\u2019\u201d. He reckons children benefit from interacting with teachers in the online classes. So far, he adds, Qin1 has had over 2,000 enrolments. In the next five years, he wants to reach over a million children in India.Contrary to the conjecture that coding is a complex subject, WhiteHat Jr\u2019s Karan says children pick it up easily. These online classes simplify coding with block-based programming. Unlike traditional coding, like Python, the programming commands are represented in graphical blocks. The children, hence, aren\u2019t required to know the entire syntax of the programming language.Meanwhile, Venkat from Balangir is on the verge of completing an app that attempts to foster positive habits in children. He explains, a child, with his/her parents and teachers, can create a list of positive and negative actions in the app and set points for them. \u201cFor example, you get five points for keeping your room tidy and minus five points for using the tablet without your parents\u2019 permission,\u201d he says.Venkat says he took five days to design and 10 days to code the app. He expects to release the app on Google Play Store soon.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Monday, Nov. 11, 2019, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX launched 60 mini satellites on Monday, the second batch of an orbiting network meant to provide global internet coverage.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n SpaceX launched 60 mini satellites Monday, the second batch of an orbiting network meant to provide global internet coverage. The Falcon rocket blasted into the morning sky, marking the unprecedented fourth flight of a booster for SpaceX. The compact flat-panel satellites just 575 pounds (260 kg) each will join 60 launched in May. SpaceX founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk wants to put thousands of these Starlink satellites in orbit, to offer high-speed internet service everywhere. He plans to start service next year in the northern U.S. and Canada, with global coverage for populated areas after 24 launches. Last month, Mr. Musk used an orbiting Starlink satellite to send a tweet- \u201cWhoa, it worked!!\u201d Employees gathered at company bases on both coasts cheered when the first-stage booster landed on a floating platform in the Atlantic. \u201cThese boosters are designed to be used 10 times. Let\u2019s turn it around for a fifth, guys,\u201d company\u2019s launch commentator said. This also marked the first time SpaceX used a previously flown nose cone. The California-based company reuses rocket parts to cut costs. Stacked flat inside the top of the rocket, the newest satellites were going to maneuver even higher following liftoff, using krypton-powered thrusters. SpaceX said there was a potential problem with one of the 60 that could prevent it from moving beyond its initial 174 mile-high (280 km-high) orbit. In that case, the faulty satellite will be commanded to re-enter and burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. Each satellite has an autonomous system for dodging space junk. In September, however, the European Space Agency had to move one of its satellites out of the way of a Starlink satellite. SpaceX later said it corrected the problem. SpaceX is among several companies interested in providing broadband internet coverage worldwide, especially in areas where it costs too much or is unreliable. Others include OneWeb and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon. According to Mr. Musk, Starlink revenue can help SpaceX develop rockets and spacecraft for traveling to Mars, his overriding ambition.

      "\nInternet could be a key way of protecting other basic human rights such as life, liberty, and freedom from torture, says a study by University of Birmingham.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \niStockphoto   Free internet access should be considered as a basic human right, according to a study which noted that people unable to get online \u2014 particularly in developing countries \u2014 lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives.Researchers from the University of Birmingham in the U.K. gave the example of Kerala, noting that the Indian state has declared universal internet access a human right and aims to provide it for its 35 million people by this year.Also read: Kerala govt. to provide free Internet to over 20 lakh BPL familiesAlso read: Where does Kerala's Internet access stand compared to other States?They explained that as political engagement increasingly takes place online, basic freedoms that many take for granted including free expression, freedom of information and freedom of assembly are undermined if some citizens have access to the internet and others do not.The study, published in the Journal of Applied Philosophy, shows that the internet could be a key way of protecting other basic human rights such as life, liberty, and freedom from torture \u2014 a means of enabling billions of people to lead \u2018minimally decent lives\u2019\u201cInternet access is no luxury, but instead a moral human right and everyone should have unmonitored and uncensored access to this global medium \u2014 provided free of charge for those unable to afford it,\u201d Merten Reglitz, a lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said in a statement.\u201cWithout such access, many people lack a meaningful way to influence and hold accountable supranational rule-makers and institutions,\u201d Reglitz said.The researchers noted that people without internet access don\u2019t have a say in the making of the rules they must obey and which shape their life chances.Reglitz added that exercising free speech and obtaining information was now heavily dependent on having internet access.The researchers said that much of today\u2019s political debate took place online and politically relevant information is shared on the internet \u2014 meaning the relative value these freedoms held for people \u2018offline\u2019 had decreased.The study attributes unprecedented possibilities to the internet for protecting basic human rights to life, liberty and bodily integrity, they said.While the researchers acknowledged that being online does not guarantee these rights, they cite examples of internet engagement that helped hold governments and institutions to account.These examples include the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 which saw new ways of global reporting on government atrocities, the researchers said.They also gave the example of the #MeToo campaign which helped to \u2018out\u2019 sexual harassment of women by powerful men.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

An infotoon on the e-booklet Cyber Safe Girl \u2014 Beti Ko Bachao, Cyber Crime Se (save your daughter from cyber crimes) tries to answer that question. Cyber security expert Dr Ananth Prabhu G, the author of the e-booklet that puts the spotlight on online safety of girls using graphic images, says, \u201cMen gain access to their private videos and photos and start manipulating them emotionally.\u201dInfo you can useLog on to cybersafegirl.com to download the free e-bookletWhile there, you can also enrol for an e-learning programme called 'cyber safe campus'. Once you go through a module, you have to take up a 30-minute online test to get a certificate that states that you are aware of staying safe from any kind of cyber crimeThe certificate issued by Information Security Education and Awareness(ISEA) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, is valid for two yearsThe e-booklet has completed over 1.5 lakh downloads. They have also distributed 10,000 printed copies of the booklet at various educational institutionsWatch out for Profile hacking: A stalker takes over your email or social networking sites and manipulates itPicture morphing: A person\u2019s face is morphed on to a body image to intimidate herOnline games: People who suffer from self-esteem and clinical depression fall prey to dangerous online games, like \u2018Blue Whale\u2019, which becomes addictive and harms themCamera hacking: Phones with no camera guard can be exploited for such criminal activitiesKeylogger: A malicious programme that can collect all login details and other sensitive informationAnanth Prabhu created the content along with entrepreneur and social activist Vivek Shetty, and under the guidance of IPS officers Sanjay Sahay, S Murugan and Roopa D. \u201cEach infotoon has a set of nine sketches that describe situations where women lay themselves open to exploitation. For example, at mobile recharge shops. When they leave their number with the vendor for recharge, anyone in the shop can gain access to the number and start harassing them with calls and lewd messages,\u201d says Ananth, who is the cyber security trainer at the Karnataka Police Academy. \u201cThere is an increase in the number of online crimes against women, especially in the last three years. We picked these 25 common crimes based on the calls from women for help. A quantum of the calls are from women whose profiles have been hacked or their pictures morphed. The experience is harrowing, but it is an avoidable one. All it needs is awareness,\u201dsays Ananth.\n\n\n\n\n\nCyber security expert Dr. Anath Prabhu G \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The e-booklet in the first version carried 15 sketches. \u201cWe added 10 more sketches in the second version and there are plans to add more in version three. In the second phase, we updated the booklet.There is an exclusive section called bonus tips that tells one how to safeguard against cyber crimes. We have added 39 various sections of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) under which the 25 crimes can be tried. There is also information on how to prevent or deal with situations where one is harassed with pornographic content.\u201dAnanth says awareness has to begin at schools. \u201cUnfortunately, most schools don't have cyber security in their syllabus. There is Information Technology Act, but no one bothers to learn it. One often ends up doing cyber crimes without being aware of their actions online.\u201dWatch out...Profile hacking: A stalker takes over your email or social networking sites and manipulates itPicture morphing: A person\u2019s face is morphed on to a body image to intimidate herOnline games: People who suffer from self-esteem and clinical depression fall prey to dangerous online games, like \u2018Blue Whale\u2019, which becomes addictive and harms themCamera hacking: Phones with no camera guard can be exploited for such criminal activitiesKeylogger: A malicious programme that can collect all login details and other sensitive information.The infotoons highlight cyber stalking, camera hacking, trolling, SMS spoofing and call spoofing where anyone can become a soft target. He gives an example of how an old women was spoofed to believe that her son is in trouble. \u201cShe received a call from a stranger, but from her son\u2019s number who is working in Dubai. He tells her to deposit a few lakhs of money in a bank account of a friend to free her son from the customs officials. She transfers the money and then learns about her folly.\u201dIn some situations, it is one\u2019s family reputation or social status that is at stake. \u201cThere is something called deep fakes. That is child\u2019s play. With the help of high-end filters, photo editors, printers, scanners, apps and other software anyone can pick your video, use your input to manipulate, blackmail and dupe you and your dear ones. This is an advance level of picture morphing which can have dangerous consequences,\u201d he explains.Exercise caution, says Ananth. \u201cAvoid posting close-up selfies. Instead, post a low resolution group photo. Be wary of suspicious e-mails or requests that asks you to share your photos.\u201d Ananth\u2019s mission is to create a cyber-safe India. He adds, \u201cInternet can be be a \u2018terrible master\u2019 or an \u2018excellent slave\u2019. It's a double-edged sword.

      "What do Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Deep Kalra, Deepinder Goyal and Ashish Hemrajani have in common? The founders of Naukri.com, MakeMyTrip, Zomato and BookMyShow are not only some of India\u2019s biggest entrepreneurs, but have also overcome near-fiascos with quick thinking and occasionally, sheer dumb luck. Sidharth Rao, co-founder of Webchutney, and an active angel investor, has documented their stories in his new book, How I Almost Blew It, published by Westland. He was recently in Chennai\u2019s Madras Management Association, to release the book, along with Bharat Matrimony founder Murugavel Janakiraman, who also features in the book. \u201cWe hear many success stories about entrepreneurs. Media reports either vanity milestones like achieving funding, or, on the opposite spectrum, tragedies like mass layoffs,\u201d said Sidharth. \u201cBut the journey of a startup is much more nuanced than that, and I wanted to trace that.\u201dThrough the course of the book, Sidharth noted common themes that emerged, like the overconfidence that comes with sitting on a lot of capital for the first time, and fights between co-founders in a startup environment where roles are not clearly defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Being what moderator Anant Rangaswami jokingly termed as a \u2018serial gambler\u2019, Sidharth\u2019s many initiatives too have seen many near-death experiences \u2014 each churning out crucial life lessons. He started Webchutney, making websites for people, at the age of 19. \u201cWe started at the peak of the dot com bubble. It was a time when everyone and their aunts and uncles wanted websites for their companies. We thought the party would last forever,\u201d he said. But the eventual dot com crash happened, post 2000, and their company had to tide over it. So it was with the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cBack in those days, when we had just started,\u201d he recalled, \u201cwe did not have enough money to book flight tickets, so we had the Rajdhani train schedule memorised. Clients would call us for meetings in other cities the very next day, and we would have to book tickets before 2 pm. Oh, and the hotels we stayed at! One in Mumbai got raided by ATS, who were very suspicious of our computer work!\u201dIt is essential that we look back at our journey and see if we fall into patterns, he emphasised. In How I Almost Blew It, he shared his own and got his peers to do the same.How I Almost Blew It is available online for \u20b9460.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIn the past few days, Mastodon has been seeing a considerable influx of Indian users, who have labelled the platform as a more egalitarian social network.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nOfficial Mastodon Blog (https://blog.joinmastodon.org/\n Mastodon, founded on October 5, 2016 by Eugen Rochko, calls itself a \u201cfederation\u201d comprising thousands of communities, similar to Reddit and with timelines much like Twitter. Like any social network, users can create profiles, post images, messages and videos, all while following other users.In a way, it has that Reddit-like feel with the open-source properties. Expressing yourself works differently too \u2013 unlike Twitter\u2019s 280-character count, Mastodon offers a 500-character space for users to express themselves.The etymology of Mastodon alludes to the mammoth-like extinct creature which is the platform\u2019s avatar. Perhaps the name of the platform refers to its indescribably large size.No, Mastodon is not new by any means. In fact they\u2019ve undergone many revisions over the past couple of years, learning from the masses and by continually developing their infrastructure. Mastodon 3.0 now promises a \u201csafer social media experience\u201d equipped with effective anti-abuse tools to protect yourself and other users from harassment as well as servers with strict codes of conduct. There are also more moderators involved in the upkeep of the platform.Also read: Campaign against Twitter by Dalit activistsMastodon\u2019s pull-factor lies in its infrastructure; so we will compare it with Twitter to make it a little more comprehensive. Twitter is centralised, meaning all interactions take place on a single server controlled by one company... but Mastodon is decentralised, meaning it is a collection of many instances which communicate with each other to form a wider network. Each of these instances, per se, have their own admin with its own policies. In this sense, it is \u2018federated.\u2019In a July 2018 blog post for JoinMastodon.org, Rochko shared he used Twitter\u2019s model to further Mastodon\u2019s development. \u201cVery early on in the development of Mastodon I\u2019ve decided that centralisation and unexpected algorithmic changes were not the only one of Twitter\u2019s problems. Harassment and tools to deal with it have always been lacking on Twitter\u2019s end.\u201d Obviously Twitter has evolved since then, creating blocking and reporting tools with permanent effects. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMastodon happening in India\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMastodon happening in India\nRochko also added, in the same post, \u201cI need to delineate that the design decisions are more about what the software nudges you towards, rather than a tamper-proof barrier against some behaviours, which is not possible. Mastodon deliberately does not support arbitrary search... What does arbitrary search accomplish? People and brands search for their own name to self-insert into conversations they were not invited to.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion this week about Twitter's perceived bias in India. To be clear, whether it's the development of policies, product features, or enforcement of our Rules, we are impartial and do not take action based upon any ideology or political viewpoint.\u2014 Twitter India (@TwitterIndia) November 7, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0There\u2019s been a lot of discussion this week about Twitter's perceived bias in India. To be clear, whether it's the development of policies, product features, or enforcement of our Rules, we are impartial and do not take action based upon any ideology or political viewpoint.This explains why, in the past few days, Indian users have labelled Mastodon as a more egalitarian social network. After the suspension of SC lawyer Sanjay Hegde\u2019s Twitter account (not once, but twice) for opinion taken out of context, users have accused Twitter of being inconsistent with its strict policies.Mastodon is comprised of individual servers, called instances, as opposed to a centralised server, the model used by platforms like Twitter.Instances like mastodon.xyz and mastodon.social are more general in its outlook: anyone can join. Other instances are restrictive in focus, which are meant for people who share specific interests, such as say, MotoGP fans.Each instance is an individual server, which is run by its owner, who moderates it, besides controlling membership to the instance, and the content that is allowed on it. For example, inditoot.com is a social network for Indians, run by Indian owners on a specific Mastodon instance, which is denoted by \u201cinditoot\u201d.Can users from one instance communicate with users from another instance? Sure. If User A from instance Red wants to communicate to user B from another instance, say, Blue, they simply add the B\u2019s Mastodon handle followed by their instance name to their \u201ctoot\u201d. In this case, it will be @B@Blue. If B wants to communicate to A, he or she will add @A@Red to their toot.Instances are not readily visible to every other instance. A pair of instances will communicate with each other only if there is a connection between a user on one instance ( i.e., a local user) and a user on the target instance.In such a case, the two instances is said to form a \u2018federation\u2019. Another policy that the owners of an instance can frame is the rules for the \u2018federated timeline\u2019 of the users of their instance. Going back to the earlier example, since person A of instance Blue follows person B of the Red instance, the federated timeline of instance Blue will now include posts from instance Red (note: the federated timeline is different from the instance-specific, or local timeline, which will contain posts by the users of that specific instance alone). This, unless the owner of instance Blue chooses to ban/prevent posts from instance Red.Since complete freedom is given to owners to moderate the kind of content that is available to users of an instance, it naturally follows that users of a particular instance are usually like-minded, or know what they are signing up for when they join a particular instance.The most recommended way for getting started with Mastodon is to sign up and join its flagship instance \u2014 mastodon.social \u2014 to get a feel of the platform.Mastodon does not have an official app. On JoinMastodon.org, one can browse Mastodon-compatible apps for Android, iOS, web, desktop and SailfishOS. Once you download the app compatible with your phone\u2019s operating system, you can sign up and start browsing the instance of your choice.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nBackground of famous social media icons. File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images\n Amid an allegation of caste-based bias and content moderation against Twitter, many Indians are now looking at its lesser know rival, Mastodon. In fact, Mastodon was among the top Twitter trends as people announced their new accounts, while encouraging others to do the same.Mastodon is very similar to Twitter or Tumblr where users can make their profiles and post messages, images or videos on the platform. They can also follow accounts that they want. However, while one \u2018tweets\u2019 on Twitter, on Mastodon the users \u2018toot\u2019 with up to 500 characters.Meanwhile, what is drawing people to it is the fact that it is a decentralised open source platform, meaning there is no one server, company or a person running it. Instead, users can create and run their own servers. Hence, Mastodon is made up of many servers, with each having its set of rules. Users can choose to interact just within these specific servers or with all servers across the platform. The network has no ads. There are also no blue tick verifications on the platform.Also read: What is Mastodon, the new social media kid on the blockWhile exactly how many Indians have opened accounts on Mastodon as part of the trend is unknown, Mastodon early on Friday, in a tweet, said, \u201cWe are seeing a lot of interest and activity in the current migration to Mastodon.\u201dOn Mastodon, its founder @Gargon or Eugen Rochko, in a \u2018toot\u2019 invited applications for a moderator who speaks Hindi for mastodon.social team. \u201cMust uphold our code of conduct, must stick around on Mastodon, some monetary compensation is included,\u201d he said.The upsurge in the trend to move from Twitter is mainly attributed to the suspension of Supreme Court lawyer Sanjay Hegde\u2019s account by Twitter. Mr. Hegde told The Hindu that Twitter had brought in a PR disaster on itself by refusing to listen. He said that apart from a junior official of Twitter no one else spoke to him. And this official too \u201ctalked down\u201d to him.Mr. Hegde said he may or may not return to Twitter, and that Mastodon, \u201cThankfully, right now it looks free of the toxic hate that threatens to overwhelm Twitter India.\u201d Mastodon was a federated experience and its moderators would be among users themselves, he observed.\u201cTwitter is behaving indifferently on suspension of Sanjay Hegde's account. It seems they are toeing the government's line alone. There is no space for an alternate narrative on Twitter, so it is only obvious that users will switch to other platforms,\u201d DMK MP from Villupuram V.C. Ravi Kumar \u2013 who was among the first MPs to join Mastodon, said.Meanwhile, an official account of Rahul Gandhi also popped up on Mastodon with toots on the three year anniversary of demonetisation. However, Rohan Gupta, social media in-charge of the Congress said, \u201cThat's not our official account. We have reported to the platform informing them that it is not us.

      "An actor has filed a complaint at Goregaon police station accusing an unidentified person of allegedly hacking his WhatsApp account and using his number to make obscene video calls to his friends and colleagues, a police official said on Wednesday.Based on the actor\u2019s complaint, the Goregaon police on Tuesday registered an FIR against the unidentified person under Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code, and provisions of the Information Technology Act, the official said.Sanchay Goswami, who has worked in films and television serials, told the police that someone gained unauthorised access to his WhatsApp account and converted it into a business account. The hacker then started sending obscene messages and making video calls to his friends, the official said. One of his female friends received a video call in which a man was seen masturbating. She immediately informed the actor about it.Mr. Goswami suspects that his Whatsapp account was hacked while he was returning from the Mumbai airport at 12.15 a.m. on Monday. The actor said he received a six-digit OTP (one-time password) on his mobile phone, but he ignored the message.He then received a call from an international number and thought it was from his brother in the U.S. The cell phone screen displayed a computer generated six-digit pin and he disconnected the call. He then started getting more calls and OTPs and his phone eventually switched off.Mr. Goswami said, \u201cThen I started getting calls from my friends and family members on my alternate number asking whether my WhatsApp account had been hacked.\u201d It was then that he learnt that his friends had been receiving obscene messages and video calls from his mobile number. The actor said a few of his friends also received OTPs and spam messages. Mr. Goswami rushed to Goregaon police station and submitted a complaint after his colleagues also started receiving obscene calls and messages on WhatsApp, the police official said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2019I am sorry\u2019: A message posted by the actor on Facebook apologising to his friends and family members.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The actor said he then posted a message on all his social media accounts, including Instagram and Facebook, apologising to his friends and family members and asking them not to accept any WhatsApp calls from his number.\u201cWe have registered the FIR and an investigation is under way,\u201d the police official said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " Two former employees of Twitter and a third man from Saudi Arabia face U.S. charges of spying for the kingdom by digging up private user data and giving it to Saudi officials in exchange for payment, according to a complaint filed on Wednesday.Ali Alzabarah and Ahmad Abouammo, who used to work for Twitter, and Ahmed Almutairi, who then worked for the Saudi royal family, face charges of working for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia without registering as foreign agents, according to a complaint filed against them.According to the complaint, Abouammo repeatedly accessed the Twitter account of a prominent critic of the Saudi royal family in early 2015. At one instance, he was able to view the email address and telephone number associated with the account. He also accessed the account of a second Saudi critic to get personally identifiable information.\u201cThis information could have been used to identify and locate the Twitter users who published these posts,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release.Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in confronting Iran, has faced intense Western criticism over its human rights record, including over last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its involvement in the devastating war in Yemen.Almutairi, for his part, is accused of acting as a go-between for the Saudi government and the Twitter employees.Abouammo is under arrest in Seattle, Washington while the other two are in Saudi Arabia, the department said.The two men were given cash and other rewards, such as an expensive watch, for the information, the complaint said.The Saudi embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Twitter said that it was grateful to the FBI and U.S. Justice Department. \u201cWe recognize the lengths bad actors will go to try and undermine our service,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe understand the incredible risks faced by many who use Twitter to share their perspectives with the world and to hold those in power accountable.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Twitter logo\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: AP  Accused of promoting and condoning caste discrimination and hierarchy, social medial platform Twitter is in the eye of a storm as a campaign against it by Dalit, OBC and tribal activists and their supporters has been trending on the platform since Saturday. On Tuesday, #TwitterHatesSCSTOBCMuslims was among the top trends and on Monday, it was #JaiBheemJaiMandalJaiBirsa \u2014 denoting a coalition of Dalits, OBCs and Tribals hailing Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, B.P. Mandal of Mandal Commission fame, and Birsa Munda, tribal freedom fighter. Campaigners have trended #CasteistTwitter, #JaiBhimTwitter and #SackManishMaheswari since Saturday. Manish Maheshwari is the managing director of Twitter India.Meanwhile, another hashtag #TwitterParRajHinduKa \u2014 Hindus rule Twitter \u2014 had begun to trend by Tuesday afternoon. Activists say the immediate trigger for the campaign was Twitter\u2019s abrupt decision to restrict the handle of Dilip Mandal, academic, journalist and author who champions social justice causes online. Mr. Mandal told The Hindu that his account was disabled by Twitter on Friday, alleging privacy violation. \u201cIn March this year, I had tweeted about a booklet titled Bahujan Agenda including the contact details of the author. The author had explicitly given me permission to tweet his contacts, but Twitter cited that as a violation of rules and restricted my account,\u201d he said. Social justice activists started a campaign #restoreDilipMandal and when it began trending, Twitter restored the account on Saturday. The platform also verified Mr. Mandal\u2019s account.Mr. Mandal, who has since called for removing the verification tick from his handle, said through this process, Twitter was mirroring the Varna system, authenticating the voice of some and silencing others. \u201cVerified handles spew venom against Dalits, tribals, OBCs and Muslims and the company does not act. It shuts down accounts that call for ending discrimination. Anecdotal evidence suggest that this is caste bias and religious prejudice,\u201d he said. Twitter campaigners against the company point out that it has not verified the accounts of film director Pa Ranjith \u2014 who has more than eight lakh followers \u2014 Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi leader Prakash Ambedkar and Bheem Army leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad and a host of other vocal proponents of lower caste rights. \u201cWe would like to know whether Twitter has any criteria for verifying an account or is it arbitrary as it appears,\u201d said Mr. Mandal. \u201cTwitter has the power to mould and influence public opinion. I have no empirical data, but it clearly smacks of caste and communal prejudice on the part of the company.\u201d Campaigners have put the spotlight on several other accounts to drive home the point that there is some unstated and underlying bias in the verification process.Replying to queries sent, a Twitter spokesperson said, the company has one set of rules and it enforces them \u201cjudiciously and impartially for all individuals \u2014 regardless of their political beliefs, religious ideology, professional position or background.\u201d\u201cWe have ongoing efforts to provide local market context when developing and enforcing our global policies. We extensively cover gender and religion (including caste) in our trainings, to provide reviewers with the local context they need to evaluate content. Our policy prohibits behaviour that targets individuals based on protected categories (including caste),\u201d the spokesperson added. On the issue of verification, the Twitter spokesperson said the public verification process is currently closed. \u201cHowever, on a case-by-case basis we do verify people who are active in the public conversation on Twitter.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The capsule carried no astronauts Monday morning, just a test dummy. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP/NASA\n  Boeing Co said on Monday that one of three parachutes failed to open during a crucial unmanned test of the CST-100 Starliner, which the company is developing to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.The deployment failure happened during a test of a system designed to propel the crew to safety in the event of an emergency, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said by email.\u201cIt's too early to determine why all three main parachutes did not deploy,\u201d Blecher said. \u201cHowever, having two of three deploy successfully is acceptable for the test parameters and crew safety.\u201dBoeing and U.S. space agency NASA said they were still targeting Dec. 17 for the Starliner's first unpiloted mission to the International Space Station.NASA has picked Boeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX as the main contractors to build rocket-and-capsule launch systems to return Americans to the orbiting research lab for the first time since the U.S. space shuttle program ended in 2011.Parachute deployment has been among the top technical challenges both companies have faced that have raised questions over crew safety and pressured launch schedules. The parachutes are designed to slow down the capsules when they return to Earth at supersonic speeds.SpaceX is working to fly its Crew Dragon capsule on a first manned test flight into orbit in the first quarter of next year, after completing its unmanned test in March, the company and NASA have said.

It has also launched Portal smart screens as well as a Workplace social network tailored for workplace productivity.Its messaging applications WhatsApp and Messenger are each used by more than a billion people.Facebook established a Calibra as a digital wallet for use with the proposed cryptocurrency Libra, which has been facing criticism from regulators and lawmakers in various countries.

      "\n\nEnglishHelper\u2019s RightToRead programme hopes to reach 20 million Government students by 2020\n\n",
      "Updated: November 4, 2019 18:31 IST\rPublished: November 4, 2019 18:31 IST",

      " It is time for English period for students of Class VII in Chennai Middle School, MGR Nagar. Instead of pulling out their textbooks from their bags and waiting for the teacher to walk in, the students sit facing a projector screen. Their textbook plays out on the screen and they sit glued to it, as a recorded voice reads out the spelling of the word \u2018surrounded\u2019 slowly, pausing after every letter. The boys and girls, dressed in maroon and cream-coloured uniforms, repeat after the voice in gusto. They will probably never forget the word\u2019s spelling.EnglishHelper, an education company, has made this possible. Its RightToRead initiative, launched in 2013, reads out English textbooks with the help of ReadToMe, powered by Artificial Intelligence. Says Sanjay Gupta, the company\u2019s global CEO, \u201cWe learn languages in a multi-sensory way. Even before we learn to speak, we listen to sounds, relate it to everyday objects; we then move on to exposure to the written aspect \u2014 our software has been designed taking this multi-sensory aspect into account.\u201dBreaking the barrierSanjay hopes that by 2020, 20 million students in 100,000 schools use their RightToRead programme.The software can be used offline and across multiple devices and systems, such as the PC, Linux, and Android.Two years after the launch in 2013, the programme reached 5,000 schools in eight states, covering one million students.In Maharashtra, RightToRead is being implemented in 65,000 schools, while the numbers stand at 300 in Tamil Nadu.Sanjay, who is based in Gurugram and has worked for large corporations in India and around the globe, decided to take the plunge into education in 2010. \u201cI met Venkat Srinivasan, a Boston-based entrepreneur and cognitive scientist of Indian origin in 2009, who was working on an interesting technology for learning English,\u201d he recalls. Venkat is the founder of EnglishHelper and when the two of them met again two years later, Sanjay decided to join the team full-time. \u201cOur pilot programme, which launched in 2013, covered six states in India,\u201d he explains. The programme has grown multi-fold today, reaching more than 3.5 million students across 15,000 schools, according to data shared by the company. Given this data-driven mission, for 2017-18, the team did impact analyses \u2014 with 20 schools in South Delhi Municipal Corporation, 10 schools in Uttar Pradesh and 11 schools in Telangana \u2014 across various grades.EnglishHelper has a simple goal: to make the teaching and learning of English easier in Government schools. To do so, Sanjay says that all the school requires is \u201cone computer and a projector\u201d. He adds that the institution can have a dedicated room which students can take turns to make use of during their English class.The company partners with various agencies to take its mission forward. These include the United States Agency for International Development. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, RightToRead was launched in partnership with American India Foundation. In certain districts such as Thoothukudi, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and The Nilgiris, the programme is being sponsored by the local administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how does it work? Once the school partners with EnglishHelper, it can send its prescribed English textbooks to be worked on by their software. Once this is done, the teacher can teach lessons by projecting the book onto a screen, and the ReadToMe software will read out every word, the speed of which can be altered according to students\u2019 needs. The control lies with teachers. \u201cThey can highlight words, change the pace of the recorded voice, translate words into Tamil, and so on,\u201d Sanjay explains.And all this happens during the class\u2019 English period. \u201cStudents can learn the language more easily and syllabus is covered as well,\u201d he points out. He adds that teachers have been supportive: \u201cTeachers are all for technology-enabled solutions,\u201d he says, adding that the initiative has been able to do away with fear for the language among certain students.Back at the Chennai Middle School, the class is almost over and the teacher asks a child to spell the new word they learnt. \u201cS-u-r-r-o-u-n-d-e-d,\u201d says a girl in two long braids, to applause from her classmates. She gets back to her seat, a smile forming on her lips.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nMobvoi TicWatch Pro review: Good to go\n\n",
      "Updated: November 5, 2019 12:24 IST\rPublished: November 4, 2019 18:07 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-2019-good-to-go/article29879599.ece",
      "It has become almost an existential question now: do you really need a smartwatch? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that even if you are not fartlek-ing (interval training) it is best to have an exercise routine, and a device helps you to get excited about, say, doing a 4k in 30 minutes, to push yourself to do more, or to checking with your doc if your resting heart rate is always in the 90s (it should be between 50 and 100). Now to the TicWatch Pro from Mobvoi, a smartwatch (launched last year abroad) that took me time to get used to its bulk. On the bright side, it has a large screen, so it is easily readable if you\u2019re on the verge of long-sightedness. The strap is leather on the outside and silicone on the inside, so sweat doesn\u2019t ruin the leather. It has also got an IP68 rating i.e. the highest possible Ingress Protection against dust (the first number) and water (the second number). Drop the device into water up to 1.5 metres deep for half an hour and it should come out okay.Powered by Wear OS by Google, it syncs easily with an Android device, so you get mobile notifications and can see messages and take calls. I didn\u2019t find I needed to take a call on the device, because I used it for fitness and to keep a track of my lifestyle: to measure steps (generally set to target 10,000), exercise (at least 30 minutes) and check heart rate (should be between 60 and 100 at rest). It is helpful that it has GPS, so on a walk or run, you don\u2019t need to carry your phone. You can also download Spotify or Google Play Music. The problem like in most of these devices, is that it measures steps even when you\u2019re driving, so if you\u2019re going long distance, best to take the watch off.SpecificationsChipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon WearOperating System: Wear OS by GoogleBattery capacity: 415mAhDisplay: 1.39\u201d AMOLED 400 x 400 + FSTN displayOne of the good things about the device is that even when the battery dies, it converts into a regular watch, so you can check on the time. There is also an essential mode which helps you save battery life. In this mode, it will only tell you the time and give you footsteps. On regular smartphone mode though, you will get a day-and-a-half of juice, especially if you are constantly waking up the phone with a flick of the wrist (yes, there is gesture control) .I enjoyed that the watch detects a workout, so begins recording a run without you having to programme it. It also has a walking, freestyle workout, and cycling mode, though it once recorded that I\u2019d cycled 60 miles in 60 minutes, which made me think I was The Flash. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t have an interval workout mode, nor can you swim with it. But it will tell you what distance you\u2019ve walked, your active hours and calories burnt.The Find My Phone, Flashlight, TicSleep (that tracks sleep), and FitBreathe (you take a break and just breathe) options are useful. It\u2019s a useful device, but at something over \u20b920k, I\u2019d have hoped to be able to take it into the pool too.Mobvoi\u2019s TicWatch Pro is priced at \u20b922,999 and can be purchased from major online retailersYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWhat impact can India\u2019s youth expect from Twitter banning political ads?\n\n",
      "Updated: November 4, 2019 17:09 IST\rPublished: November 4, 2019 17:01 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-impact-can-indias-youth-expect-from-twitter-banning-political-ads/article29878940.ece",
      "Scrolling through Twitter and seeing the mention of \u2018Thread\u2019 means there is juice to a story, which cannot be confined to 280 characters. One person who does not need to fuel a fire like that is Jack Dorsey.On October 31, many woke up to the Twitter CEO\u2019s announcement that political advertising is a no-go on the platform, and much of it has to do with the capitalist culture within a \u2014 supposedly \u2014 democratised space. \u201cA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or re-tweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimised and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money... This is not about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle.\u201d This is a 180-degree move from Twitter\u2019s decision on February 19 to extend their Ads Transparency model to India, which allowed anyone around the globe to view ads that have been served on Twitter, with even more details on political campaigning ads, including ad spend and targeting demographics. \n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\u2014 jack (@jack) October 30, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0We\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026Dorsey says these online ads present \u2014 with \u201cincreasing velocities, sophistications, and overwhelming scales\u201d \u2014 wholly new challenges to civic discourse, such as Machine Learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and, not to mention, DeepFakes.The pull of political ads may make sense for many tweeters who are annoyed with the littering of \u2018Promoted\u2019 political content. Gone are the days of flexis being the go-to messaging for parties. Tweets, posts, stories, snaps... these are new hoardings. Dorsey adds, \u201cWe considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we are stopping these too.\u201dTwitter obviously did not come up with the new changes overnight. On October 24, a week before the announcement was made, Twitter\u2019s public policy manager Ronan Costello announced the platform is building a partnership with UNESCO on media and information literacy. This 18-month project comes to fruition in the form of a new handbook for educators, Teaching and Learning with Twitter, which is available in nine languages, including Hindi.This handbook hopes to drive young people \u2014 using the digital classroom known as the Internet \u2014 \u201cto ask the right questions about content they engage with online, and critically analyse news and information they engage with on the service,\u201d writes Ronan, in a blog post that same day. Before the problem of incumbents came about, the platform clearly thought of a significant deterrence.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoez Chakchouk \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMoez Chakchouk, assistant director-general of UNESCO, explains in the blog post, \u201cPolarised information is driving a rise in hate and discrimination and is often amplified by inauthentic and malicious activity, while disinformation is compromising democracy and development. Promoting media and information literacy learning through social media platforms, such as this Twitter and UNESCO collaboration, could be far-reaching if systematically implemented and sustained.\u201dHowever, Radhika Ganesh, activist and convener at national organisation Young People For Politics \u2014 which develops a working system that facilitates positive generational influx into politics \u2014 doesn\u2019t believe this move will amount to anything, suggesting that this was a way for Twitter to cover their bases.While Dorsey understands Twitter is a small part of the greater political ads ecosystem, he adds, \u201cSome might argue our actions today could favour incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising.\u201d It is worth pointing out that there is no tangible evidence of the effect political advertising has on people. It can be argued that there are more confronting advertisements around sexual health or popular culture out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nSrivatsa YB, the National Campaign in-charge of Indian Youth Congress and former social media head of Karnataka Congress, points out political advertising on Twitter is not so big in India. \u201cFor the Karnataka Assembly elections, we didn\u2019t use it at all. Twitter advertising is mostly used by brands here. So, it doesn\u2019t affect our party much. Having said that, it is good that Twitter has come forward and said it is not going to make money off political ads. Facebook is more problematic with political ads and the spread of fake news. There should be regulation on Facebook and Instagram as well to create an even playing field.\u201dSimilarly, Sorav Jain, CEO of digital marketing agency echoVME, says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will create a big impact in India. Political parties here don\u2019t use Twitter for advertising; it is mostly about campaigning and personal branding. Most of the politicians have their own IT wings. They participate in a trending hashtag or they make one trend. You are less likely to see them using promoted trends. The ban is only going to affect a new politician, who might try to increase his or her followers through paid ads. The ones who are already there on Twitter have established a base.\u201dRadhika Ganesh explains, \u201cThis is a deflection from the actual problem. Banning political ads, especially in India, won\u2019t have a massive impact; they\u2019re not the only political mobilisers,\u201d says Radhika, \u201cLook at the influencer market or individual tweets \u2014 we do not know what is real any more. Political ads have had some sort of a replacement effect, especially across the urban opinion-making classes. Social media is in the process of becoming an integral political tool. Paid ads play an important role, particularly for those who do not have access to these larger propaganda missionaries. Young candidates have made the most of social media to mobilise opinions for them. I don\u2019t, however, see a huge dent happening after this new policy.\u201dBilal Zaidi, the co-founder of political fund-raising platform OurDemocracy.in, feels marketing and advertising is an important part of communication. \u201cOurDemocracy.in is in the business of amplifying campaigns of newcomers in politics. They cannot afford ads in mainstream media. It is difficult. So, Facebook and Google marketing allows us to target a new audience.\u201dA dark numbers gameStocks-savvy people would have noticed that within just 12 hours of the announcement, Twitter shares dropped as far as 4%, before a further 1.8% lower in extended trading. Clearly, some parties were disappointed with potential advertising reach being snatched away.To the argument that Twitter ads influence voters, Zaidi says, \u201cThe question, ethically, is not whether \u2018advertising is okay or not\u2019; it is \u2018is there a level playing field?\u2019 We let people spend crores of rupees on Facebook ads, others aren\u2019t getting the same kind of visibility. We have been advocating the introduction of a cap on money that can be spent online. Digital marketing in politics creates opportunities for newcomers. We don\u2019t want it to end; we want it to be regulated.\u201dDorsey says that a final policy will be shared by November 15, and enforced from November 22. From what has been gathered, this may not change much for the platform. How people will interact with their feeds may be different, but in terms of action, given the issue isn\u2019t about free expression, one should note that this new policy doesn\u2019t stop political tweeting altogether, nor should it.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Krishnan\n WhatsApp had informed the Indian government in September that 121 Indian users were targeted by the Israeli spyware Pegasus, but the IT Ministry has contended the information received from the messaging app earlier was inadequate and incomplete, according to sources.Sources at WhatsApp said the messaging platform has responded to the government\u2019s query last week, seeking an explanation to the Pegasus spyware that helped unnamed entities\u2019 hack into the phones of journalists and human rights activists across the world, including India.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp alerted Priyanka Gandhi on possible phone attack, says Congress\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp alerted Priyanka Gandhi on possible phone attack, says Congress\nIT Ministry sources said they have received a reply from WhatsApp and are studying it, and that a view on it will be taken soon.While declining to comment on the details of the fresh response sent last week, sources in WhatsApp said the company had reached out to the government in September as well, its second alert on the issue after its communication in May.They said the Facebook-owned company had, in the September communication, flagged that 121 users in India had been impacted by the spyware.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018WhatsApp did not inform govt. of system breach\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018WhatsApp did not inform govt. of system breach\u2019\nIT Ministry officials said they had received communication from WhatsApp in the past, but maintained the information that came in earlier was inadequate, incomplete and full of technical jargons.WhatsApp did not respond to queries over the matter.The messaging giant, on Thursday, had said Indian journalists and human rights activists were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities using an Israeli spyware Pegasus.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WhatsApp breach, follow the money trail\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WhatsApp breach, follow the money trail\nWhatsApp had said it is suing NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance firm, that is reportedly behind the technology that helped unnamed entities\u2019 hack into the phones of roughly 1,400 users, spanning four continents that included diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials.However, WhatsApp did not say on whose behest the phones of journalists and activists across the world were targeted. Refusing to divulge identities of those targeted in India, WhatsApp had said it had, in May, stopped a highly sophisticated cyber attack that exploited its video calling system to send malware to its users.The spyware allegedly allows compromised devices to give access to a phone\u2019s camera, mic, messages, e-mails and even location data. The hackers could have access to contents of the entire device.WhatsApp had said it had sent a special message to about 1,400 users globally that it has \u201creason to believe were impacted by this attack to directly inform them about what happened\u201d. Over the past few days, several social activists in India have come forward and said they had received communication from WhatsApp in this regard.WhatsApp has over 1.5 billion users globally, of which India alone accounts for about 400 million.On Thursday, after WhatsApp\u2019s disclosure that the spyware had targeted Indian users as well, the Indian government had asked WhatsApp to explain the matter and list out measures that were taken by the app to protect the privacy of its users.While NSO has so far maintained that it only sold its \u201ctechnology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies\u201d, government officials have asserted that the Indian government has no dealings with the Israeli company.Government officials had also questioned the \u201csuspicious\u201d timing of the disclosure of the hacking incident, particularly against the backdrop of Supreme Court allowing the Centre three months to come up with rules to curb misuse of social media in the country, and the continued demand for bringing in traceability of originators of malicious content.\n\n\n\nWatch | Explained: Pegasus, the spyware that came in via WhatsApp\n\n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/puN1HSgT-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

But the screen is, somehow, not as cluttered as you\u2019d expect it to be: especially if you\u2019re using Closed Captioning (CC) along with the pop-up text for the choices you must make. While some may brush it off as simple tech, it is really not.At production houses like Netflix, a major chunk of this is due to the work of the globalisation and accessibility departments. Accessibility, as a form of content production, is strategic to the formula for their content to stay relevant while connecting with digital audiences. In an exclusive interview with Weekend, Kathy Rokni, the company\u2019s director of globalisation, gets candid about inclusion on an innovative level.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does Netflix stay up-to-date with the legalities of accessibility and content delivery in each country/region to unify strategy?  Obviously, Netflix complies with accessibility laws in all countries, where they apply and exist. The reality is that not all countries have strong laws or have taken actions along these lines.

We started in the USA with Audio Description (AD) and CC because our goal is to become accessible to people in many more countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the mobile-exclusive plan in India, how do you ensure an uncluttered experience on a smaller screen? India is the first, and at present, the only country to have the mobile plan. We work with a very strong design team and a consumer insight team, whose jobs are to research the best ways of providing viewers with an immersive experience, visually, audio-wise and text-wise. As we learn from our members and from the research, we apply the findings to our products \u2014 mobile, in this case. It is an ever-growing process, and we hope to continuously improve. Have there been any challenges or roadblocks Netflix has experienced in terms of sensitivities? I wouldn\u2019t call them roadblocks, they are more sensitivities, as you said. As a company which started in the USA, we learned a lot from our global members, especially about how to connect them with great stories. One of our biggest learning points? The assumption that people want content that\u2019s familiar isn\u2019t accurate. You\u2019d think this was common knowledge but we\u2019ve observed a vast consumption of secondary assets \u2014 such as subtitling and dubbing. And members have returned to that content. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the warnings for those with photo-sensitive epilepsy, but do accessibility aspects seep into physical production like sound design and visualisation?Given we do a lot of AV testing, there\u2019s a strong discipline in leaning into innovation, learning and being at the edge of technology while making content. On a production level, there are \u2018best practices\u2019 that don\u2019t impact the creative content. For example, when we do our subtitling, we are conscious of boxing the text if the background on the screen is white. When adding classic films or series to your lineup, what measures does your team take to make this content accessible?Actually, the older content is quite permissive. Our hope as a content-maker is that more people enjoy it. Regardless of genre, we can always create the appropriate facilities, be it AD or CC. That\u2019s the beauty of content. In terms of licensed content, we work with our partners to get access to the secondary assets. In the case of, say, Friends, there\u2019s no AD though. Let\u2019s talk interactive films; Bandersnatch was a success and Netflix has more coming out soon. Have you done anything with interactive films to make them more accessible? We\u2019re definitely working on it. One of the things we\u2019ve just been doing, on the product side, is positioning the subtitles, or we can position the captioning so that it\u2019s still immersive and doesn\u2019t compete.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get technical. Tell us about the process of creating audio descriptions (AD)To create audio descriptions, you need a script adaptor, a director and trained voice talent. Challenges include writing to fit gaps, while still leaving room for key silences and background sounds, editing on the fly, finding the right voice talent (for example: Female narrator for a male-heavy show to make differentiating easy, younger voices for kids\u2019 shows). A good example is the sequence in the house in SeE7 of Stranger Things, where the demogorgon attacks. There\u2019s a lot happening in that scene; and the demogorgon is CGI, of course. But the AD throws in short descriptions without overwhelming the sounds, so as to remain immersive. The job of an audio descriptions script adaptor is to explain the scene and the situation while paying attention to the creative intent \u2014 without it dominating dialogues or any of the background music, which are key to the content. There\u2019s a director for recording ADs, who directs the voice talent in a manner similar to a dubbing director. The ADs go through the same quality check as the language dubbing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe kicked off our audio description initiative in English with Marvel\u2019s Daredevil \u2014about a blind superhero\u2014and have been increasing the number of shows/films we cover, as well as the languages we support. Today we support 10,000-plus hours of audio description on Netflix globally covering most of our originals and films, in up to 36 languages.Earlier this year, there was talk a Rumble Pak project which uses vibrations and haptics for mobile.  Innovation is at the heart of what we do at Netflix. We want to use it to not just tell better stories, but also to tell them to more people. Hack Day acts as a great platform for such innovations. And we look to see how these ideas can help make the experience better for our members. Rumble Pack was one of the most exciting things to come out of Hack Day this year. And mobile is exciting for us, as you know \u2014 with Smart Downloads, vertical previews, the mobile plan in India, adaptive streaming. So we continue to see how this can be made useful.

      "\nSeveral U.S. senators have recently noted concerns about censorship and data collection on TikTok\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n The U.S. government has opened a national security investigation into the Chinese-owned video app TikTok, The New York Times reported on Friday.The report, citing anonymous sources, said the review by an intergovernmental panel may be looking into whether the app, popular for its music videos, was sending data to China.The investigation is led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a government panel that reviews acquisitions in the United States by foreign companies, the report said. The news comes after lawmakers called for a review of the national security risks of TikTok, warning it could be used for spying by Beijing.A review could look into the acquisition in 2017 of TikTok, which at the time was known as Musical.ly, by Beijing-based ByteDance. The deal gave the Chinese company the app, which has been popular with youth for homemade karaoke videos and which now has an estimated 500 million users worldwide.Senator Marco Rubio welcomed news about the review. \u201cLast month I asked @USTreasury to conduct a CFIUS review of @tiktok_us,\u201d Mr. Rubio tweeted. \u201cBecause any platform owned by a company in #China which collects massive amounts of data on Americans is a potential serious threat to our country.\u201dSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator Tom Cotton last week suggested that TikTok\u2019s owner ByteDance could be forced to share user information with Chinese intelligence. \u201cWith over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,\u201d the two Senators said in a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.The Senators also warned that TikTok could potentially be used to influence voters in next year\u2019s election.TikTok said it could not comment on any regulatory matter but noted that it \u201chas made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nVishal Shah, vice-president, product, Instagram, at a media interaction in Mumbai on Friday.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini After Twitter announced that it would ban political advertising, Instagram has revealed its intention to go bullish on shopping and platforming influencers and businesses in India. The Facebook-owned social network giant hosted over 250 creators and marketers, including Priya Varrier and Mallika Dua, at an \u2018Instagram Experience\u2019 event in Mumbai on Friday.Instagram launched its \u2018Born to Instagram\u2019 initiative to discover creators from across the country, and help them leverage the platform for business. The \u2018Born to Instagram\u2019 will roll out in 15 cities, enabling creators from big and small cities to collaborate and provide them with mentorship opportunities. Vishal Shah, vice-president, product, Instagram, shared IPSOS India study according to which 95% of people contacted said Instagram helped them decide whether to buy a product or service. Encouraged by this, Instagram will start testing augmented reality-based shopping, first in the U.S., but no timeline has been set for an India launch. Mr. Shah said the social network platform has recently introduced several provisions to ensure the \u201cwell-being\u201d of its users. It is currently testing the removal of the number of likes that appear under a post. \u201cResearch shows people face a lot of pressure and competition from these likes,\u201d Mr. Shah said. To tackle online bullying, Instagram recently launched a \u2018restrict\u2019 feature, which protects the user\u2019s account from unwanted interactions, without completely blocking them. \u201cWhen you put a wall around your bully, you don\u2019t know what they are doing or whether they are bullying you through someone else\u2019s account,\u201d he said. In addition, Instagram is adding a comment warning, informing the user that their content may be considered offensive, giving them a chance to review their comment.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nShopping app AM Needs caters to your daily morning supplies\n\n",
      "Updated: November 1, 2019 18:49 IST\rPublished: November 1, 2019 17:30 IST",

      "\nAM Needs team\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement  Jikku Mary Kurian is relieved that she no longer has to stock milk in her refrigerator. Now, every morning, by 7 or so, she gets as many sachets as she wants delivered to her home in the city. Same is the case with Murphy Harikumar, who does not have to step out to buy milk, vegetables or bread. AM Needs, an online home delivery service, takes care of their morning needs.App-based service providers aren\u2019t a novelty any more. Yet Sujith Sudhakaran and Ranjith Balan, the founders of AM Needs, went ahead with the venture, which is slowly reaching households in the city and in Kochi since its launch six months ago. \u201cWe have been running e-commerce-based companies in Technopark for 15 years now and wanted to expand the scope of the domain by launching something that has a wider reach. Our initial plan was to deliver only milk since that is needed every day in most households. But when we realised that it won\u2019t be enough to sustain the operation, we decided to add more products,\u201d says Sujith.In addition to milk and dairy products of Milma, vegetables from Horticorp (cut and uncut), eggs, bread and breakfast essentials, AM Needs also has products that are not usually stocked in shops. \u201cFor example, the long-life milk of Milma, egg white/whole egg liquid in tetra packs and egg white cubes. We also provide periodicals and publications of The Hindu,\u201d Sujith adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivery hands of AM Needs \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nThe duo says that there is competition as small shops and supermarkets now take up online and offline home delivery. \u201cApp-based shopping has had exponential growth in the recent time; the best examples being the food apps that have made a huge impact. So people are familiar with this mode of shopping and we felt this is the right time to make the best of this scenario. But it is important to be sustainable since there are many small-scale vendors who also supply essential goods at your doorstep. So before we launched AM Needs, we conducted a sample survey among 100 people from a cross-section of society, including doctors, techies, government employees\u2026 Nearly 82 % of them said that they would welcome such a service and that boosted our confidence,\u201d says Ranjith.\n\n\n\n\n\nAM Needs delivery person supplying milk to a client\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nOnce you download the app, the orders have to be placed before 7 pm if you need the items the next morning. Customers can opt for short-term or long-term subscription and can pause it when not needed. The products will be delivered between 5 am and 8 am. There are no delivery charges. \u201cMost of our delivery boys work for the food delivery apps, which begin their service by 8 am. So our employees can finish their work with us by that time,\u201d Ranjith adds. At present, 65 delivery boys are working for AM Needs in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi.A highlight of AM Needs\u2019 delivery model is creating \u201cmicropreneurs\u201d, Sujith points out. \u201cIf the delivery boy belongs to a particular PINCODE, he can build a clientele for AM Needs\u2019 products in that area, thus becoming our delivery partner. He can identify new clients by introducing our products or helping them to download the app and to do online payment. They get a share of the profit. Already, five delivery boys in the capital city have become micropreneurs,\u201d he says. \n\n\n\n\n\nVegetables being supplied by an AM Needs delivery person\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nThe company, which now has four more directors on board, will soon start operations in Kozhikode and has plans to move to Kollam, Kottayam, Thrissur and Palakkad. \u201cWe are planning to add more items to the product list. Customers can suggest the products they want.

      "\n\nChina rolls out nationwide 5G telecom services \n",
      "Updated: November 1, 2019 16:24 IST\rPublished: November 1, 2019 16:24 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/china-rolls-out-nationwide-5g-telecom-services/article29854084.ece",
      "\nA woman uses her smartphone at a display for 5G services from China Mobile at the PT Expo in Beijing, Thursday, Oct. 31, 2019. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n China\u2019s three major state-run telecom operators have unveiled their superfast 5G network across the country, as the country aims at becoming the global leader in next generation telecom technology surpassing the US and other western nations. State-owned carriers China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom unveiled their 5G data plans on Thursday as China and the U.S. are embroiled in a power struggle over trade and technology. The three firms in simultaneous moves unveiled their monthly 5G plans with prices ranging from 128 yuan (about \u20b91,289) to 599 yuan (\u20b96,030). Subscribers will be able to enjoy connections way faster than 4G and less expensive data per gigabyte, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. 5G is the next generation cellular technology with download speeds stated to be 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G LTE networks. The 5G networking standard is seen as critical because it can support the next generation of mobile devices in addition to new applications like driverless cars. The 5G commercial services are now available in 50 cities, including major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Shanghai had activated 11,859 5G base stations by mid-October, which will support the 5G network coverage across the city\u2019s key outdoor areas, the report said. The three major mobile operators have already registered over 10 million 5G users before the official commercialisation launch, it said. Beijing, which is embroiled in a trade and technology war with Washington, is hoping to woo India and other countries with its 5G telecom technology.  China and the U.S. have been fighting for leadership in the technology sector in recent months, with Chinese tech giant Huawei at the centre of their power struggle. The Trump administration has blacklisted Huawei, arguing that it poses a national security risk. The U.S. has also lobbied allies to shun the Chinese company from their 5G networks. Huawei denies this charge, and many in China see the U.S. actions as part of its efforts to curb the rise of the world\u2019s second largest economy. According to an estimate made by the China Telecom, the country is expected to be a front-runner in the adoption of 5G services with over 170 million 5G subscribers by next year. South Korea will be in second place with a predicted 75,000 users, followed by the U.S. with 10,000, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a research note last week.The U.S. recently blacklisted Chinese telecom giant Huawei, citing security and espionage-related concerns, and is now persuading its allies, including India, to block the world\u2019s largest provider of networking gear and the second biggest smartphone maker, from their new and upcoming mobile networks. The Indian government has allowed Huawei to take part in the 5G trials during the India Mobile Congress held last month in New Delhi. China has been asking India to take independent and objective decision to permit Huawei 5G services in the backdrop of the U.S. pushing for a global ban on the telecom firm over \u201csecurity issues\u201d. China is expected to have over 600 million 5G subscribers by 2025, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global total, the Xinhua reported, quoting a senior telecom official as saying. However, sceptics are doubtful about the 5G speed. They say China\u2019s powerful firewalls, which control the internet, might slow down the services. The firewalls actively block several international social media platforms like Twitter, Google and Facebook. Meanwhile, major handset makers have also forayed into the 5G technology market. As many as 18 5G smartphone varieties were rolled out this year, and some 7,87,000 5G handsets were shipped, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Chinese tech giant Xiaomi unveiled two 5G smartphones in September, while Huawei will start selling its 5G-version MATE 30 series on Friday with prices starting at 4,999 yuan (USD 700).\u201cInnovation in applications will be the focus of 5G\u2019s next-stage development,\u201d Xinhua quoted Hu Houkun, deputy chairman of Huawei\u2019s board of directors, as saying. For mobile operators and related enterprises in both the upstream and downstream of the industry, enriching application scenarios will be indispensable in providing better network experience and forming a virtuous cycle for 5G businesses, Mr. Hu said. Wang Zhiqin, deputy director of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology under the MIIT, said 5G technology will provide key infrastructure for the development of China\u2019s digital economy.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHow to watch Apple TV+ without switching to Apple\n\n",
      "Updated: November 1, 2019 16:36 IST\rPublished: November 1, 2019 16:18 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/how-to-watch-apple-tv-plus-without-switching-to-apple-2019/article29854036.ece",
      "Social media is abuzz with the new content from Apple TV+ which was announced at CEO Tim Cook\u2019s September keynote at the Steve Jobs Theatre in California.It\u2019s a pretty deal at just \u20b999 a month. Apple has stated that Apple TV+ will be available on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV 4K, Apple TV HD, Apple TV (3rd generation), iPod touch and Mac. To subscribe to Apple TV+, customers must update to iOS 12.3 or later, tvOS 12.3 or later and macOS Catalina. But you do get to start with a seven-day free trial.Apple isn\u2019t without its remarkable strategies, of course. At the keynote, Tim Cook also announced that customers who purchase any new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch starting September 10 can enjoy one year of Apple TV+ for free. Plus, beginning November 1, customers can initiate the one-year free offer in the Apple TV app on the device running the latest software.Here\u2019s the catch: customers have three months after device activation to claim the offer, or if the device was purchased and activated before the launch of Apple TV+, they will have three months starting November 1.The natural response one will have is to think \u2018I\u2019ll have to have an Apple device for that, won\u2019t I?\u2019 followed by a consideration to trade an organ in for such. Yes, yes, we know... Apple\u2019s tight-knit ecosystem can be a bit of a pain but there\u2019s a loophole and we\u2019re more than happy to leap through it.Apple has stated that Apple TV+ will also be available on the Apple TV app on select 2018, 2019 and newer Samsung smart TVs, and on Amazon Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony and VIZIO platforms in the future. The keyword here is \u2018select\u2019, so don\u2019t fret if your model isn\u2019t saddled with the update.The Internet has been churning with reports that some Sony Android TVs compatible with AirPlay 2 \u2014 most likely their Z9G Series (2019), A9G Series (2019), X950G Series (2019) and X850G Series (2019 85-inch, 75-inch, 65-inch and 55-inch models).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the October 29 2019 story on 9to5Mac.com \u2014 which broke the news \u2014 was recently updated, \u201cSony told us it was a mistake and they have no further news about the app launch for everyone, but it\u2019s clearly coming in the near future since some people already got it.\u201d So how did this realisation come about? Apparently a recent firmware update to some Sony TV models in Brazil was the tip-off.But that does not necessarily mean you have to trade in your existing television for these pricey gadgets... unless you want to.For quite a while, Apple and Amazon have been buddying up nicely. On October 10 2019, Amazon Music was loaded on to the Apple TV interface after the launch of Apple Music on Fire TV back in March. So on October 24, a press release from Amazon Fire TV stated that, from today, customers in over 60 countries can download the Apple TV app.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an extra perk, the experience is also Alexa-enabled: users can use Alexa Voice Remote \u2014 included with every Fire TV or a paired Echo device \u2014 to easily start watching their favourite shows and movies or discover a new Apple Original from Apple TV+. All customers need to do is ask Alexa Voice remote to \u201cfind the Apple TV app\u201d and then download and install the app. After installing the application users will just need to say \u201cAlexa, watch Dickinson\u201d or \u201cAlexa, find dramas.\u201d And don\u2019t forget, Alexa is Hindi-compatible too.The Apple TV app is already available for Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen) and Fire TV Stick 4K, in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and India.Then there\u2019s the browser experience..."

Rivals China Telecom and China Unicom are also offering services at comparable prices in major cities, according to notices on their websites.The ultra-fast mobile internet service, which is 100 times faster than existing 4G networks, allows consumers to download full-length films within seconds, or use apps with virtual reality. The technology will also pave the way for driverless cars, further automation in factories, and allow users to remotely control appliances such as coffee makers and ovens via the internet.China is expected to be a front-runner in the adoption of 5G services with over 170 million 5G subscribers by next year, according to estimates by China Telecom.South Korea will be in second place with a predicted 75,000 users, followed by the US with 10,000, analysts at Sanford C.

Despite the success of 5G networks at home, Chinese telecom equipment giants have faced regulatory push back abroad.The US Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it was considering blocking telecom carriers from buying equipment from Chinese tech companies Huawei and ZTE. The US is also threatening crippling sanctions on Huawei, which is expected to be a leading player in offering 5G network hardware.Washington has expressed fears that Huawei\u2019s equipment could contain security loopholes that allow China to spy on global communications traffic, and has been lobbying European countries to stay clear of it.The company has repeatedly denied the US accusations.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nPavan with his \u2018emergency health intimation\u2019 device.\n\u00a0 When a senior citizen or a physically-challenged/bedridden person staying alone faces a medical emergency, he/she would have no way of immediately reaching out to their loved ones.This prompted rural innovator Kurakula Pavan to come up with the \u2018Emergency Health Intimation\u2019 device. The GSM-based device is equipped with a SIM card and remotely connects a bedridden person to five friends or relatives. All one has to do is plug the device into a power socket near one\u2019s bed (which works for 48 hours on battery support). In case of an emergency, the person has to simply touch the vibrating sensor-based device that not only blares an alarm to alert the neighbours, but also calls five pre-registered mobile numbers across the globe. \u201cThe calls go out on a rotation basis to each of the five numbers, till someone reaches the spot to reset the device,\u201d Mr. Pavan told The Hindu.Mr. Pavan said that the device would infuse confidence and courage among senior citizens who are staying alone in villages. \u201cMy friend\u2019s ailing parent died of a cardiac arrest and his inability to convey it to his son sleeping in the adjoining air-conditioned room prompted me to come up with an invention that could bridge the communication gap,\u201d Mr. Pavan said.Hailing from the little-known Moram village in Palamaner mandal of Chittoor district, Mr. Pavan is widely acclaimed as a rural innovator who received the \u2018Young Scientist\u2019 award in 2009 from A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. He is known for applying principles of basic science to address small, yet pressing problems in rural areas.His first major invention was to remotely operate a water pump, which helped save farmers\u2019 lives from electric shocks and snakebites. Some of his innovations are a home burglar alarm, honey bee-like buzzing sound to ward off tuskers from fields in forest fringe villages, rural FM station, heartbeat monitoring system, two-wheeler security system, power generation from ceiling fan, self-operating street light system for civic bodies and so on, developed in over a decade\u2019s time through his \u2018Pavan Empower Solutions\u2019. These won him laurels, with some of his endeavours also fetching him commercial success.Mr. Pavan recently received an award from the National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD Hyderabad) for the device that is reckoned as a path-breaking intervention in ensuring rural healthcare.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

On October 29, it identified the malicious code as Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli company, NSO. WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook have sued NSO in a U.S. court.The code is transmitted by calling the target phone on WhatsApp. The code enters the phone even if the call is not answered. According to some reports, the log of that call gets erased. According to The Citizen\u2019s Lab of the University of Toronto, which worked with WhatsApp on identifying spyware victims, this is only one of the ways of delivering Pegasus.

It could steal messages from even services that offer encryption because it was taking the messages before the encryption process, according to anti-malware service Kaspersky. The controller can also turn the phone into a spying device by switching on its camera or microphone.According to reports, over 100 human-rights activists, lawyers, and journalists were targeted across the globe. This included several lawyers and journalists in India.According to Kaspersky, Apple\u2019s iOS security update 9.3.5 take care of the vulnerability exploited by Pegasus.

      "\nThe peer-to-peer, UPI-based WhatsApp Pay service is expected to reach over 400 million users \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Facebook is inching closer to launch much-anticipated WhatsApp Pay in India and will soon have a positive news to share, the company\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said.Data compliance issues and regulations have kept WhatsApp Pay launch in abeyance for quite some time, despite a successful test run of the payments service with one million users in the country.\u201cWe have our test going in India. The test really shows that a lot of people are going to want to use this product. We\u2019re very optimistic that we\u2019re going to be able to launch to everyone in India soon, but of course will share more news when we have that,\u201d Zuckerberg told analysts on an earnings call on Wednesday.The peer-to-peer, UPI-based WhatsApp Pay service will reach over 400 million users \u2014 especially the small and medium businesses (SMBs) \u2014 to boost digital inclusion in the country.The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have expressed concerns over some of WhatsApp\u2019s features in complying with the regulations.WhatsApp had earlier said it had built a local system to store payments-related data to comply with the RBI\u2019s data localisation requirement, but later in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the RBI said WhatsApp\u2019s Pay is yet to comply with its data localisation norms.\u201cWe differentiate between payment systems that are built on top of the existing financial infrastructure like what we\u2019re trying to do with WhatsApp payments or when we make payments in Instagram Shopping, and our work with something like Libra that is trying to build some new technological infrastructure for financial services,\u201d Zuckerberg elaborated.Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said if WhatsApp meets the regulatory norms from RBI and National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), then it should be allowed to start digital payment operations in the country.It is nearly a necessity for WhatsApp to launch the payment service as it is in direct competition with giants like Alphabet\u2019s Google Pay, Walmart-owned PhonePe, Amazon Pay and Alibaba-backed Paytm. These companies are in a fierce competition to dominate the digital payments industry in the country which is estimated to hit $1 trillion by 2023.According to a report by Omidyar Network and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), nearly half of MSME owners with annual business revenue between \u20b93 lakh and \u20b975 crore would use WhatsApp Payments once it is fully rolled out.During the earnings call, Dave Wehner, Chief Financial Officer at Facebook, said daily active users reached 1.62 billion, up 9 per cent compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines.\u201cThis represents approximately 66 per cent of the 2.45 billion monthly active users in September,\u201d Wehner informed.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Indians were less apprehensive of pre-roll advertisements, with 84.8 per cent being either affirmative or neutral if the content is free. Indians mostly watch online videos from home, followed by travel or commute. \u201cSince India is new to the digital bandwagon, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that 89 per cent are also subscribed to cable TV. This figure was observed to be the lowest for Japan, where the subscriptions turned out to be just 39 per cent or less than half as compared to India,\u201d the company said in a statement.The adoption of dedicated streaming devices is also gradually increasing in India with 27 per cent of the respondents saying they owned Google Chromecast and 34 per cent owned Amazon Fire TV Stick. Eighteen per cent of the respondents, however, didn\u2019t have any streaming device at all.\u201cIndia is quickly opening up to the idea of online video streaming. This ongoing trend has been highlighted time and again by our State of Online Video studies over the years.

Smartphones were the primary streaming device while digital devices such as computers and laptops came next on the list followed by a connected device or a smart TV.

      "\nRepresentational image. File \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Twitter may have decided to ban political advertisement on its platform, but Facebook has said it will not do so as these ads form an important \u201cvoice\u201d for candidates and advocacy groups.\u201cIn a democracy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news. Although I\u2019ve considered whether we should not carry these ads in the past, I\u2019ll continue to do so, on balance so far I\u2019ve thought we should continue,\u201d Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an investor call.He cited the examples of Google, YouTube, cable networks and national broadcastors that also run such advertisements on their platforms.Stating that ads are an important \u201cvoice\u201d \u2014 especially for candidates and advocacy groups \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg asserted the company\u2019s stance was not aimed at driving revenues.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter to ban all political ads from November\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter to ban all political ads from November\n\u201cI can assure you, from a business perspective, the controversy this creates far outweighs the very small per cent of our business that these political ads make up. We estimate these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our revenue next year. That\u2019s not why we\u2019re doing this... I believe the better approach is to work to increase transparency. Ads on Facebook are already more transparent than anywhere else,\u201d he said.Facebook, which has around 2.8 billion users across its family of apps globally, clocked $17.6 billion in revenue in the September 2019 quarter.The company has been under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators after incidents of user data breach, and the platform being used to spread misinformation around the 2016 elections in the U.S.The company has also received sharp criticism from various quarters for allowing politicians and their campaigns to post almost anything, including false and misleading claims.Facebook, which has undertaken efforts in the past few years to deal with misinformation on its platform, said it is also testing removing like counts on Instagram and Facebook to help people engage in meaningful interactions.In India, where the 17th Lok Sabha elections were held earlier this year, Facebook\u2019s Ad Library Report showed that 1.21 lakh political ads, with a total spending of more than \u20b926.5 crore, were put up on the platform between February and May 15, 2019.The Indian government had warned social media organisations of stern action if any attempt was made by them to influence the country\u2019s electoral process through \u201cundesirable means\u201d.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook News to forge business ties with media outlets, says Mark Zuckerberg\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook News to forge business ties with media outlets, says Mark Zuckerberg\n\u201cVoice and expression have been important for progress throughout history. They\u2019ve been important in the fight for democracy worldwide. I believe that voice and free expression are an important part of the path forward today, and that\u2019s why our company will continue standing for these principles,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said on the investor call.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments also assume significance as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has announced that the company will stop all political advertising on the platform globally. The decision comes into effect from November 22.In a series of tweets, Mr. Dorsey had said the company believes that political message reach should be earned, and not bought.\u201cA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimised and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\u201d\u201cInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The presence of this kind of data automatically rules out skimmers installed on websites (Magecart attacks), where Track 1 and Track 2 is never used.\u201dCriminals who buy card dumps from Joker\u2019s Stash typically use the data to clone legitimate cards and withdraw money from ATMs in so\u2014called \u201ccash outs.\u201dIn February, card details for 2.15 million Americans were put up for sale on Joker\u2019s Stash.In August, nearly 5.3 million card details obtained from gas and convenience chain Hy\u2014Vee customers were also dumped on Joker\u2019s Stash.Over the past five years, Joker\u2019s Stash has become one of the premier underground credit card shops through significant releases of stolen credit cards from data breaches at companies like Target, Walmart, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor, and British Airways.On August 22, the dark web store released the first batch of stolen credit card data (dumps) from an alleged point\u2014of\u2014sale (POS) breach at the gas and convenience chain Hy\u2014Vee.

      "\nPhoto for representational purpose only.\n\u00a0 Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp , one of Facebook Inc's content review contractors, said on Wednesday it would shut its content moderation business that would result in about 6,000 job cuts.The information technology services provider will also eliminate up to 7,000 jobs in its other units to invest in growth areas such as cloud and internet of things to cushion the impact from a decline in spending by its financial customers.The exit from the content moderation business will hurt financial performance in the coming year, Cognizant said.\u201cOver the coming quarters, we intend to comply with our contractual obligations and determine the best path forward with affected clients,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin said on a conference call, without naming the clients.Cognizant had about 500 workers in Hyderabad looking for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos, Reuters reported in May.When asked about Cognizant's exit from the business, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner on a post-earnings call on Wednesday said the company works with multiple partners and will continue to do so.Facebook works with at least five outsourcing vendors in at least eight countries on content review, according to a Reuters tally.The social network said in December it has about 15,000 people, a mix of contractors and employees, working on content review and had over 20 content review sites around the world.Cognizant had come under pressure after activist investor Elliott urged the company to boost shareholder value after disclosing a more than 4% stake in November 2016. The hedge fund exited the stake last year.The company said it expects to save between $500 million and $550 million in 2021 and record restructuring charges of between $150 million and $200 million by the end of next year.The New Jersey-based company said revenue from its financial services segment rose 1.9% to $1.49 billion while that from healthcare services dropped 1.2% to $1.18 billion. The two segments make up more than half of the company's total revenue.Cognizant has warned of lower spending by its banking sector clients in the second half of the year.The company said it now expects full-year revenue growth of between 4.6% and 4.9%, compared with its earlier guidance of a growth of between 3.9% and 4.9%.Excluding items, the company earned $1.08 per share, above estimates of $1.05 per share.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The two segments make up more than half of the company's total revenue.Cognizant said it expected current-quarter revenue between $4.20 billion and $4.24 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $4.22 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The company forecast full-year 2019 revenue growth between 4.6% and 4.9% from an earlier outlook of growth between 3.9% and 4.9%.The information technology services provider reported net income of $497 million, or 90 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $477 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.08 per share, above estimates of $1.05 per share.

      "\nSamsung says its mobile business posted a 32% rise in operating profit in the third quarter.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said chip sales should pick up in 2020 as it reported a 56% fall in third-quarter operating profit on Thursday, reeling from memory price declines amid a prolonged industry downturn.Samsung said there were positive signs for the chip outlook thanks to anticipated demand from data-centre customers and the continuing expansion of 5G smartphones.But the South Korean tech giant warned that prospects for 2020 should be viewed with caution as uncertainties remained in the macroeconomic environment, a likely reference to the future of U.S.-China trade relations.The world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones said operating profit was 7.8 trillion won ($6.7 billion), slightly above the 7.7 trillion won estimate the company released earlier. Revenue fell 5.3% to 62 trillion won, in line with its earlier estimates.Samsung's profit has slumped on-year for four consecutive quarters and it is expected to fall again in the current quarter, analysts say.Earlier this month its cross-town chip rival SK Hynix said 5G-enabled smartphones should help lift the global memory market out of the doldrums next year.Analysts say strong smartphone sales cushioned the profit fall, with U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies effectively barring U.S. firms from supplying the Chinese competitor.Samsung said its mobile business posted a 32% rise in operating profit to 2.9 trillion won in the third quarter.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n  Beijing will use facial recognition tools to speed up security checks in the city\u2019s overcrowded metro, using a \u2018credit system\u2019 to sort passengers into different channels, State-run media reported on October 30.Long queues and commuters arguing with staff over slow security procedures are common sites during rush hour in the metro system of the 20 million-strong metropolis. The city plans to install cameras that will scan the faces of passengers as they enter a subway station and sort them into different security channels, said Zhan Minghui, director of the Beijing Rail Traffic Control Centre. He said the plan involves creating a \u201cpassenger credit system\u201d.Those who receive \u201cabnormal feedback\u201d after their faces are scanned will be subjected to extra checks.Mr. Zhan did not offer details on the criteria used to sort passengers or what could trigger that type of feedback.\u201cThe technique aims to improve the efficiency of security checks and includes both body checks and luggage screening when large numbers of passengers enter the station,\u201d he told an urban transportation forum in Beijing on October 29.The Beijing subway in May said it has started \u201cdeducting credit points\u201d from passengers who eat in railway carriages.The city\u2019s subway system currently handles over 12 million trips on a work day and the number is expected to increase to 17 million trips by 2022.Mr. Zhan did not offer a timetable for rolling out the technology.Facial recognition is gaining traction across China, where it is being used for everything from supermarket checkouts to surveillance.While researchers have warned of the privacy risks associated with gathering facial recognition data, consumers have widely embraced the technology.The Universal Studios amusement park under construction in Beijing recently said it will admit visitors without a ticket \u2014 thanks to cameras that will scan their faces to determine if they paid for entry.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The South Korean tech giant teased the new concept on Tuesday at the Samsung Developer Conference 2019 in the United States.\u201cThe amazing thing with the foldable technology is that it can also become more compact like this,\u201d said Sally Hyesoon Jeong, head of Framework R&D Group at Samsung\u2019s mobile communications, showing the mock-up on a screen behind her. \u201cIncredible, right?\u201d Jeong said, followed by applause from the floor.The world\u2019s largest smartphone maker is powering ahead with the launch of 5G phones and $2,000 foldable handsets as it battles rivals Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in an increasingly saturated market. Its new design enables the device to fold in half horizontally.\u201cThis brand new form factor we are now exploring not only easily fits in your pocket but it also changes the way you use the phone,\u201d Jeong said.China\u2019s Huawei started taking orders last week in China for its eagerly awaited foldable smartphone, hoping to make up for weak overseas sales amid US trade sanctions. Samsung did not provide details about when the square-folding phone would be launched.\u201cWhile we can\u2019t comment on future products, Samsung is committed to pioneering the foldable category, including investing in the development of new form factors,\u201d Samsung said in a statement to Reuters.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nWhatsapp logo.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: AFP WhatsApp on Tuesday sued Israeli technology firm NSO Group, accusing it of using the Facebook-owned messaging service to conduct cyberespionage on journalists, human rights activists and others.The suit filed in a California federal court contended that NSO Group tried to infect approximately 1,400 \u201ctarget devices\u201d with malicious software to steal valuable information from those using the messaging app.WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the lawsuit was filed after an investigation showed the Israeli firm\u2019s role the cyberattack, despite its denials.\u201cNSO Group claims they responsibly serve governments, but we found more than 100 human rights defenders and journalists targeted in an attack last May. This abuse must be stopped,\u201d Mr. Cathcart said on Twitter.The lawsuit said the software developed by NSO known as Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed to hijack devices using the Android, iOS, and BlackBerry operating systems. \n\n\n\nWatch | Explained: Pegasus, the spyware that came in via WhatsApp\n\n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/puN1HSgT-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\nThe complaint said the attackers \u201creverse-engineered the WhatsApp app and developed a programme to enable them to emulate legitimate WhatsApp network traffic in order to transmit malicious code\u201d to take over the devices.\u201cWhile their attack was highly sophisticated, their attempts to cover their tracks were not entirely successful,\u201d Mr. Cathcart said in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, noting that the investigation found internet-hosting services and accounts associated with NSO.The suit calls on court to order NSO Group to stop any such attacks and asks for unspecified damages.WhatsApp in May called on users to upgrade the application to plug a security hole that allowed for the injection of sophisticated malware that could be used for spying at the messaging app used by 1.5 billion people around the world.The malicious code was transmitted through WhatsApp servers from about April 29 to May 10, targeting devices of attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and other senior foreign government officials, according to the complaint.\u201cA user would receive what appeared to be a video call, but this was not a normal call,\u201d Mr. Cathcart said of the cyberattack.\u201cAfter the phone rang, the attacker secretly transmitted malicious code in an effort to infect the victim\u2019s phone with spyware. The person did not even have to answer the call.\u201dThe NSO Group came to prominence in 2016 when researchers accused it of helping spy on an activist in the United Arab Emirates.Its best-known product is Pegasus, a highly invasive tool that can reportedly switch on a target\u2019s phone camera and microphone, and access data on it.The firm has been adamant that it only licenses its software to governments for \u201cfighting crime and terror\u201d and that it investigates credible allegations of misuse, but activists argue the technology has been instead used for human rights abuses.Danna Ingleton of Amnesty International said the results of the WhatsApp investigation \u201cunderscore that NSO Group continues to profit from its spyware products being used to intimidate, track, and punish scores of human rights defenders across the globe, including the Kingdom of Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico.\u201d Ingleton said Amesty and other groups are seeking in the Israeli courts to block NSO for exporting the technology.\u201cWhatsApp deserves credit for their tough stance against these malicious attacks, including their efforts to hold NSO to account in the courts,\u201d she said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nPhoto for representation.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n An Australian regulator has filed a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc's Google, accusing it of misleading smartphone users about how it collected and used personal location data, advancing a global crackdown on the world's biggest tech firms.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said the local Google unit did not tell users of its Android operating system for almost two years that they needed to switch off two settings - not one - if they did not want the company to keep their information.\u201cGoogle's conduct caused users to understand that personal data about their location was not being obtained ... by Google when in fact personal data was being obtained,\u201d the ACCC wrote in a Federal Court filing on Tuesday, which it published on its website. \u201cThe misleading information provided by Google meant that users were not able to make an informed choice.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company would defend the matter, that the company was reviewing the ACCC's allegations and that it would continue to engage with the regulator.The lawsuit is the first of several the ACCC said it would pursue against the local arms of global technology companies like Google and social media firm Facebook Inc when it called for tougher laws concerning privacy and content-sharing.Already European Union countries have seized on the bloc's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules to rein in big technology companies. In January, a French regulator fined Google 50 million euros ($55.5 million) for breaches of privacy laws.Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner is also investigating Google over a complaint alleging breach of privacy laws, while Facebook agreed in July to a record-breaking $5 billion fine in the United States to resolve privacy concerns dating back to its use of people's data in the 2016 presidential election.The Australian lawsuit against Google is seeking unspecified penalties and orders requiring the publication of corrective notices by Google, the ACCC said.The Australian regulator said in its lawsuit that Google failed to make clear that people should turn off two location-based settings, \u201cLocation History\u201d and \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d, to stop the company collecting and using data from either.Google further misled consumers - and breached Australian consumer law - by telling them the only way to prevent the company from collecting their location data was to stop using its main services like Google Search and Google Maps, the regulator said.\u201cWe want declarations that the current behaviour should not continue,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney. \u201cWe want significant penalties and ... we want Google to have to let people know what has gone on, so that people have a greater awareness of what data is actually being collected here and what it is being used for.\u201dThe matter is scheduled for a case management hearing on Nov. 14, according to the Federal Court website.

Raja Simhan Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras will soon establish a startup to deploy their Artificial Intelligence software \u2018AISoft\u2019 to develop solutions to engineering problems in fields such as thermal management, semiconductors, aerospace and electronic cooling applications. A team of researchers led by Vishal Nandigana, assistant professor, Fluid Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT-Madras developed the AI and Deep Learning algorithms. The idea is only new and being looked at by only a few research groups across the world and most of these research groups use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or C-GAN (conditional generative adversarial network) to solve engineering problems.\u201cWe tested AIsoft and used it to solve thermal management problems. We found it to be nearly million-fold faster compared to existing solutions currently used in the field,\u201d Mr Nadigana said, highlighting the unique aspects of these algorithms. \u201cOur research saves the computational time, which is the bottleneck to solve most engineering problems,\u201d he added. Mr Nadigana said that since the software they have developed can work with sparse data sets and solve engineering problems, this makes them stand out when compared to commercially available software.

      "\nRepresentational image. File \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP   Google parent Alphabet on Monday reported a sharp drop in profits over the past quarter as it ramped up spending for the launch of a wide array of new gadgets and services.Profit dipped 23% from a year ago to $7.1 billion as revenue grew 20% to $40.5 billion for the California tech giant and internet search leader.Shares in Alphabet fell 1.1% in after-hours trade on the weaker-than-expected profits.Digital advertising at Google continued to be the primary money-maker at Alphabet \u2014 accounting for some $34 billion in revenue.But revenue from other sources including cloud computing climbed more than 40% to $6.4 billion, according to an earnings report.Alphabet has been pumping money into research and development for artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and launching new Pixels smartphones and other hardware.Research and development costs rose 25% from last year to $6.6 billion and sales and marketing expenses were up 20% at $4.6 billion.Earlier this month, the company unveiled its latest Pixel handsets, which include features such as motion-sensing for gesture control and facial recognition.\u201cWe continue to invest thoughtfully in talent and infrastructure to support our growth, particularly in newer areas like Cloud and machine learning,\u201d Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement.The company, which faces antitrust reviews over its dominance of internet search on both sides of the Atlantic, has been seeking to diversify its business with more hardware and new services.Losses on \u201cother bets\u201d such as delivering internet services from high-altitude balloons ballooned to $941 million in the quarter, compared to a $727 million loss in the same period a year earlier.Last month, the Wing unit spun out of a \u201cmoonshot\u201d lab at Alphabet said a new drone service was beginning, and would be transporting medical supplies and other goods in a rollout of commercial operations.The Alphabet results were impacted by a one-time charge of $549 million, believed to be linked to a tax settlement with French authorities.Alphabet said it set aside nearly $1.6 billion as a provision for income taxes, up from $891 million last year and that its effective tax rate would be 18%, double that from a year earlier. Last week, Google claimed to have developed a new generation of quantum machine that vastly outperforms the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer.The company also said it had made a leap forward in search with an assist from its machine learning efforts.Google chief Sundar Pichai said in a statement: \u201cI am extremely pleased with the progress we made across the board in the third quarter, from our recent advancements in search and quantum computing to our strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube and Cloud.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Apple has announced its AirPodsPro, equipped with Active Noise Cancellation and promising a better sound experience in an all-new lightweight, in-ear design. And, yes, the Pro version is a bit pricier than the original AirPods, costing \u20b924,900.For many, AirPods weren\u2019t the most comfortable earphones; so to further maximise comfort, AirPods Pro implements an innovative vent system to equalise pressure, minimising the discomfort common in other in-ear designs. AirPods Pro is sweat- and water-resistant, ideal for active lifestyles. Plus, the Pro range uses a new force sensor on the stem which makes it easy to adjust volume, play, pause or skip tracks, and answer or hang up phone calls.Just like the original \u2013 through additional charges from the Wireless Charging Case \u2013 AirPods Pro delivers over 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time.AirPods Pro comes with two modes, new to the AirPods range: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and Transparency Mode. And no, neither are exactly new in the world of headphones and earphones.If we\u2019re getting technical, the structure itself is different; the Pro range's take on ANC involves two microphones combined with advanced software to continuously adapt to each individual ear and headphone fit \u2013 ultimately removing background noise.Basically, the first microphone is outward-facing and detects external sound to analyse environmental noise. AirPods Pro then create an equivalent anti-noise that cancels out background noise before it reaches the listener\u2019s ear. A second inward-facing microphone listens toward the ear, and AirPods Pro cancels remaining noise detected by the microphone.To provide perspective: ANC continuously adapts the sound signal 200 times per second. And in ANC mode, AirPods Pro delivers up to four and a half hours of listening time and up to three and a half hours of talk time on a single charge.Transparency Mode is fairly self-explanatory, providing users with the option to simultaneously listen to music and the environment around them.Switching between ANC and Transparency is through the Control Centre on an iPhone or iPad.Then there\u2019s Immersive Sound, which uses Adaptive EQ, automatically tuning the low- and mid-frequencies of the music to the shape of an individual\u2019s ear. Enter a custom, high-dynamic -range (HDR) amplifier, which claims to produce richer sound while also extending battery life, and powering a custom high-excursion, low-distortion speaker driver designed to optimise audio quality and remove background noise. The driver provides consistent, rich bass down to 20Hz and detailed mid- and high-frequency audio.This year, Apple has been vocal about machine learning experiences integrated into as much of their ecosystem as possible, so AirPods Pro claims to be no different.AirPods Pro are available across India\u2019s Apple Authorised Resellers at \u20b924,900.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Obsidian is a studio you probably have never heard of, but you\u2019ve probably had the most fun in the games they\u2019ve created, such as the legendary Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 and Fallout: New Vegas. Their latest game, The Outer Worlds, is a masterpiece. What is it about?Welcome to an elaborate alternate future where worlds are dominated by corporations. You play a lucky but also not-so-lucky individual left on a derelict colony ship. Picked out by a possibly mad scientist and whisked off on a mission that drops you in the middle of a conspiracy in the furthermost colony called Halcyon.Immersive plot-placement in the game stretches corporation-controlled realms to a new level. As you explore every facet of Halcyon, life is revealed to be twisted by hyper-advertised and stringent control on all the characters in the game to some extent, while you bask in the hilarity and dark beauty of it all. The Outer Worlds drinks deep from the pulp science fiction of the sixties and adds a heavy dose of dystopia.The Witcher 3: Wild HuntDeveloper + Publisher: CD ProjektPrice: \u20b94,200 ($59.99) for Nintendo SwitchThere are many hard choices to make in the game, with some real effect on the colony and its denizens.How does it play?Usually, Obsidian games are infested with bugs on-launch, but The Outer Worlds is squeaky clean. While it may resemble Fallout on the surface, this game has a smooth and fast first-person gameplay, letting you dive into it with a host of guns and weapons, ultimately letting you slow down time for precise targeting as a side-effect of hibernation.The RPG elements work well, and extend to not only tweaking your character but also your colourful cast of party members that accompany you on your way.The game looks magnificent, from crisp discoloured outdoors to neon-clad streets. It is easily one of the best-looking games out this year and one of the most unique.Should you get it?If you have Fallout withdrawals, The Outer Worlds offers a complex concoction of story-telling and excellent first-person action, working in unison.If you are familiar with The Witcher in action, it would be hard to clock \u2018Wild Hunt\u2019 as a title. One of the best open-world role-playing games of the decade, on Nintendo\u2019s plucky handheld, that is both a dream come true and something that requires immersive gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it about?In Wild Hunt, you play a mutant-monster hunter paid to take care of magical and mystical pets, usually ones that eat up entire villages. Geralt \u2014 to be played by Henry Cavill in the Netflix series \u2014 travels the land in search of his past. The Outer WorldsDeveloper: Obsidian EntertainmentPublisher: Private DivisionPrice: \u20b93,499 PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC (Epic)How does it play?The way the entirety of Wild Hunt\u2019s massive sandbox areas, with all its quests, fit into a playable state on the Switch, is magical. This includes all the expansion content, making this easily hundreds of hours of playtime on those commutes.The biggest question, \u2018does it look any good?\u2019 is legit. The game holds up today graphics-wise. It looks great, only in handheld mode. Just don\u2019t dock it to your TV. There are a few compromises in graphical quality, none too noticeable. Gameplay does knock down your battery life to under three hours, so be vigilant.Should you get it?Wild Hunt normally would require a hefty time commitment, and having it on the Switch makes this one of the best ways to experience this classic.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nOnePlus 7T review: A go-getter for a deluxe \n",
      "Updated: October 28, 2019 16:55 IST\rPublished: October 28, 2019 16:29 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/oneplus-7t-review-a-go-getter-for-a-deluxe/article29813539.ece",
      "Regardless of the ups and downs of my experience with the device over a period of six days, I know for certain that the OnePlus 7T, is great value for money. At under \u20b940,000, the device wins on responsiveness, visuals, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ along with the Fluid AMOLED 90 Hz display. Not only is it fast to touch, it is also much more sensitive than the iPhone 8 Plus. The colours on streamed videos were richer, and the brightness of the screen felt vivid without being harsh. Its sound quality is great with Dolby Atmos support. A few hours on this device, and my old iPhone 8 Plus felt a little... dated.SpecificationsDimensions and weight: 160.94 \u00d7 74.44 \u00d7 8.13mm; 190gDisplay: 90 Hz Fluid Display HDR10+Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+; 8 GB + 256 GB UFS 3.0Battery: Warp Charge 30T; 3800 mAh BatteryGPU: Adreno 640The device itself was much lighter, too. Its matte-frosted back felt less like a hazard to use without a cover when compared to the iPhone 8 Plus\u2019 glass back, though some users of the older OnePlus models thought the 7T was heavier in comparison to its predecessors and worse off in terms of grip. The same set also complained about the 7T\u2019s screen height, but I thought it was ideal \u2014 the 6.55-inch screen, with an effective use of the almost-no-bezel experience, gave me a clear big-phone experience, while still allowing me to reach both ends of my keyboard without effort (or having to split the keyboard virtually).Currently, as people are gung-ho about the Dark Mode on screens, the 7T\u2019s \u2018Reading mode\u2019 is an interesting choice to have \u2014 the phone dips into a comfortable medium between the inky jet-black and the standard light. The mode comes with two options: \u2018chromatic\u2019 for a sort of faded Eastman colour experience, which is better on the eye than the \u2018mono\u2019, which is a watery black-and-white. This, unlike Dark Mode, applies to all apps, making OnePlus\u2019 Oxygen OS on Android 10 truly unique.The 7T\u2019s battery life too, which my old iPhone 8 Plus isn\u2019t known for, was a great new lifeline for me, as I spent a whole afternoon video-calling with no immediate need to plug in. This started at noon, with about 85% battery, with the phone reassuring me that (usage unchanged, perhaps) I\u2019m good to go till 8.30 pm. Around four hours later however, I was down to 33%. A quick warp charge for about 15 minutes though brought me up to 90%. At 6 pm, it tells me this can hold till 5 am tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like the intentionality behind the Zen mode, the equivalent of which on the Apple ecosystem is Screen Time. The latter is more of a \u2018control\u2019, while the Zen Mode endears itself by virtue of it being a choice you seek out and commit to.I must admit that the first few days with the device were not without its drawbacks. As someone who is taking the plunge into a whole new ecosystem, the OnePlus 7T\u2019s first boot-up suggestions were a big turn-off. It had asked me to use the OnePlus Switch route, which involves downloading an app of the same name onto the iPhone, which should guide you through the rest of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it didn\u2019t show up on the AppStore, nor did its QR code, as displayed on the 7T, work. I put the device away for a few days after this experience. The second time around, however, it asked me to do a Google Drive back-up and make the switch \u2014 simpler and more straightforward, this experience was a breeze.During the initial two days, the 7T\u2019s display would flicker when I moved indoors from a sunny balcony. But it eased off entirely by the fifth day. App crashes, especially when setting up Gmail accounts on the native Google mail app, were also a problem, but it ran fine once we got over that hump.Another point of concern is with the much-talked-about wide-angle lens in the phone\u2019s horizontal triple-camera set-up. I felt like the wide-angle pictures distorted around the edges, like I\u2019ve adjusted the picture\u2019s X-skew a little. However, the macro mode was impressive \u2014 letting me see details in leaves and in my couch\u2019s texture my eye couldn\u2019t. If in the next couple of years, OnePlus is able to truly master its own unique ecosystem \u2014 a field it has stepped into with the TVs launched last month \u2014 the brand will be in competition with Google and Apple in the lifestyle-tech space.OnePlus 7T can be purchased at major online and offline retailers: 8GB/128GB at \u20b937,999 and 8GB/256GB at \u20b939,999.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA demonstration of precision spraying of fertilizers with the help of a drone in Assam. Special Arrangement\n\u00a0  The leaves in your cup of tea could soon be plucked by a pair of robot-assisted hands.India\u2019s oldest tea company has begun the process of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to help take the industry to a sustainable future from its \u2018past perfect\u2019 present state.Investing in robotic drones for precision treatment of a diseased tea bush and implanting molecular markers in leaves to develop traits for mass production will not lead to retrenchment, insisted the Assam Company India Limited (ACIL), which has depended on labourers for 180 years.The \u201cembrace\u201d of cutting-edge technology in the labour-intensive industry is aimed more at dealing with a shortage of farmhands and ensuring a scenario where workers find it more remunerative to return to the plantations, said officials of the 180-year-old company.There are challenges in replicating the AI, deployed in farming in developed nations, for use in the tea sector, industry officials said.\u201cWe have the technology to implant molecular or genetic markers in plants but tea is a new area for us,\u201d said Avital Tractitman of Israel\u2019s SMX, one of several global AI firms engaged by ACIL for a pilot project.Such markers control the genes of a plant for developing resistance to pests and diseases, improving the quality and quantity of the yield.\u201cWe have been involved in similar projects in Asia where AI has uplifted lives of the workers besides maximising production efficiencies,\u201d said Nataraj Balasubramanian of U.S.-based Smart Farms. \u201cFor tea plantations, we are working on two types of drones \u2014 one that analyses plant health, soil conditions and other natural factors and the other that sprays fertilisers or targets pests from 6-8 ft with precision so that other bushes are not affected,\u201d he added.Tea Board chairman Prabhat Bezbaruah is hoping technology would help add value to the tea industry that is currently going through a \u201cbad patch\u201d because of falling prices, rising cost of production and aged tea bushes.\u201cWe are looking at technology for taking care of cancer and tuberculosis-causing jobs such as spraying of fertilizers and pesticides but not as a replacement of the workers who would be absorbed in other jobs,\u201d said B.R. Shetty, the Dubai-based chairman of BRS Ventures, which took over ACIL in 2018. Bringing technology and innovation will not impact the lives of the 26,000 farmers across our 14 estates,\u201d he asserted.ACIL has since made a comeback of sorts with the handmade golden tea from its Maijan Tea Estate fetching a record \u20b970,501 per kilogram at the auction in August.Dr. Shetty said the bigger goal behind the pilot project on AI was to go beyond ACIL\u2019s tea estates and touch lives in every plantation across India through technology such as tracking the plucker of the best teas for transferring to her account a share of the price as reward.\u201cWe plan to provide the expertise to other estates free of cost. As the first in the business, it is the responsibility of the Assam Company to overcome the crisis,\u201d he added.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-tweaks-search-to-throw-more-relevant-results/article29805881.ece",
      " Google has announced a major update in its Search algorithms to better understand people\u2019s queries and throw more relevant results.By applying new neural networking techniques, Google said it can offer more relevant results for about one in 10 searches in the US in English and support for other languages and countries will come later.The technology behind the new neural network is called \u201cBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\u201d (BERT) which Google first introduced last year.\u201cBy applying BERT models to both ranking and featured snippets in Search, we\u2019re able to do a much better job helping you find useful information,\u201d Pandu Nayak, Google Fellow and Vice President, Search, said in a blog post on Friday.Google sees billions of searches every day, and 15% of those queries are ones it has not seen before.\u201cWhen people like you or I come to Search, we aren\u2019t always quite sure about the best way to formulate a query. We might not know the right words to use, or how to spell something, because often times, we come to Search looking to learn \u2014 we don\u2019t necessarily have the knowledge to begin with,\u201d Nayak explained.BERT models can consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it \u2014 particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.\u201cSome of the models we can build with BERT are so complex that they push the limits of what we can do using traditional hardware, so for the first time we\u2019re using the latest Cloud TPUs (Tensor Processing Unit) to serve search results and get you more relevant information quickly,\u201d said Mr. Nayak.For longer, more conversational queries, or searches where prepositions like \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cto\u201d matter a lot to the meaning, Search will be able to understand the context of the words in your query.\u201cWe\u2019re also applying BERT to make Search better for people across the world,\u201d said Google.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nPhoto for representation\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n The Pentagon has awarded Microsoft a $10-billion cloud computing contract called JEDI .The contentious bidding process for the contract pitted Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle, among others, against one another.Bidding for the huge government contract has attracted more attention than usual, sparked by speculation early in the process that Amazon would be awarded the deal. Tech giants Oracle and IBM pushed back with their own bids. Oracle also challenged the bid process in federal court, but lost.The resulting system will store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the U.S. military to use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities.The Department of Defence emphasised in an announcement that the process was fair and followed procurement guidelines.Over the last year, Microsoft has positioned itself as a friend to the U.S. military. President Brad Smith wrote last fall that Microsoft has long supplied technology to the military and would continue to do so, despite pushback from employees.Microsoft, Amazon, Google and other tech giants have faced criticism from their own employees about doing business with the government, especially on military and immigration related projects.Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organisations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds.Now, it plans to pay them for news headlines reportedly millions of dollars in some cases.Enter the \u201cNews Tab\u201d, a new section in the Facebook mobile app that will display headlines and nothing else from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, NBC, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, among others. Local stories from several of the largest U.S. cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.Tapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is one thing publishers have been requesting from Facebook\u2019s news efforts for years.It\u2019s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.Facebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying \u201ca range of publishers for access to all of their content.\u201d Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn\u2019t sure it \u201cmakes sense \u201d to pay news outlets for their material.But now, as Mr. Zuckerberg told in an interview, \u201cthere\u2019s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.\u201dNews executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.\u201cIt\u2019s a good direction that they\u2019re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,\u201d said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. \u201cThe trouble is that most publishers aren\u2019t included.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a \u201cwide range\u201d of publishers.\u201cWe think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.\u201dIn a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.Facebook killed its most recent effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.But what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they\u2019ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater \u201cemotional resonance\u201d over news that \u201callows public discourse to take place,\u201d said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley. \u201cIt deepens my concern that they\u2019ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,\u201d he added.The social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist\u2019s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.Facebook says a small team of \u201cseasoned\u201d journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the \u201cToday\u2019s Story\u201d section of the tab, designed to \u201ccatch you up\u201d on the day\u2019s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users\u2019 interests.That sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News , a free iPhone app. But Apple\u2019s effort to contract with news organizations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.Apple\u2019s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Google may also be spooked after its contractors in Pittsburgh voted to unionize last month,\u201d said the report.The company was yet to issue a statement on this.After staging a walkout against workplace harassment, Google employees organised sit-in protest at the IT major\u2019s offices across the world.The group \u201cGoogle Walkout For Real Change\u201d announced the sit-in protest on Twitter.In November, nearly 20,000 Google employees across the world walked out following the company\u2019s mishandling of sexual harassment allegations.A Google spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe prohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share our very clear policy.\u201d\u201cTo make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google, we give employees multiple channels to report concerns, including anonymously, and investigate all allegations of retaliation.\u201dTwo Google employees were retaliated against for helping to organise a walkout among thousands of company workers in November 2018.Claire Stapleton, a walkout organiser and 12-year company veteran, said in the email she was told she would be demoted from her role as marketing manager at YouTube and lose half her reports.Google employees have also demanded that parent company Alphabet\u2019s CEO Larry Page must immediately meet them and publicly address their concerns.In a post on online publishing platform Medium, \u201cGoogle Walkout For Real Change\u201d said recently that the company has had six months to meet their demands.Google employees also called for a transparent, open investigation of HR and its \u201cabysmal handling of employee complaints related to working conditions, discrimination, harassment and retaliation.\u201d\u201cGoogle\u2019s HR department is broken.

      "Microsoft Corp's Azure cloud services grew more slowly in its first quarter even as profit and revenue beat estimates, the company said on Wednesday, a sign that competition is picking up in its fastest-growing business.Revenue from Azure increased 59% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but came in well below last year's 76% growth.Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been diversifying from its Windows operating system software, and has focused on its cloud services, in which customers move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.Strength in that business powered Microsoft's market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc's AWS and Alphabet Inc's Google.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft's results \u201cwere strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.\u201dBut Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.\u201cAzure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.\u201dWorldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38% year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to $26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%.Microsoft shares, up 34% for the year, were 0.25% lower at $136.90 in after-market trading.The technology company's personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its revenue, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.Windows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs.Mike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.Net income rose 21% to $10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14% to $33.06 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.25 per share on revenue of $32.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nAn October 2019 handout picture shows a component of Google\u2019s quantum computer at the company\u2019s lab in Santa Barbara, California.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Researchers at Google say they have achieved \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019, in which a computer harnessing the properties of sub-atomic particles did a far better job of solving a problem than the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer.Given the task of finding a pattern in a seemingly random series of numbers, Google\u2019s quantum computer produced an answer in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. It estimates that the Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u00a0in Tennessee would take 10,000 years to complete the task.According to Google, such a huge win fulfils the accepted definition of supremacy. Simply put, this entails solving a computing task that a conventional computer would struggle to, or never, complete.But what does that actually mean in the research context, and when will quantum computing affect us? Here\u2019s an explainer:Quantum supremacy is a holy grail for researchers in the field: It\u2019s when the superior potential of quantum computing is finally achieved in practice \u2014 effectively superseding existing forms of computing.Conventional computers use \u2018bits\u2019 \u2014 or ones and zeroes \u2014 as the basis of their calculations. In simple terms these represent \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019, or \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019. In combination, bits can be used to handle logical tasks. Quantum computing makes use of a property of sub-atomic particles in which they can simultaneously exist in different states. A quantum bit, or qubit, can thus be both one and zero at the same time. In the jargon, this is called superposition.Another property of sub-atomic particles is for them to become \u2018entangled\u2019 \u2014 meaning that they can influence each other\u2019s behaviour in an observable way. Combining entanglement with superposition leads to exponential increases in computing power with each additional qubit. The Sycamore processor designed by Google, a unit of Silicon Valley technology giant Alphabet, had 54 qubits arranged in a two-dimensional grid. In the experiment only 53 could be made to work - still enough to produce a successful result. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle claims quantum computing breakthrough; others say hold on a qubit\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGoogle claims quantum computing breakthrough; others say hold on a qubit\nPhysicists have been talking about quantum computing for over 30 years, but the challenges of making them work are daunting. The qubits need to be cooled to just above absolute zero to reduce \u2018noise\u2019 - or vibration - that introduces errors into the calculations made by a quantum computer. Google\u2019s researchers, in solving the problem with a high degree of fidelity \u2014 or accuracy \u2014 can reasonably claim to have achieved a significant milestone, say physicists.Critics, including rival IBM, say Google is hyping its achievement and creating the misleading impression that quantum computers have effectively rendered all conventional computers obsolete. By adding disk storage the Summit supercomputer - which is made by IBM - could have solved Google\u2019s random number problem in at most two-and-a-half days, with greater accuracy, they say. Sceptics also argue that Google has only solved a very narrow task, and that quantum computing is still a long way away from practical use. In the real world, quantum computers are likely to work in harness with classical computers, making use of their respective strengths. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\nResearchers from the Google AI research team see potential uses for quantum computing in fields such as machine learning, and materials science and chemistry. They admit, though, that still-greater accuracy will be needed to bring those use cases into the real world. Cryptographers are, meanwhile, already preparing for the day when quantum computers might be used to crack the codes used, for example, to secure online access to bank accounts. So, even before quantum computing becomes widely used, \u2018post-quantum cryptography\u2019 is already here.Google, with its \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 headline, is staking a claim to leadership in the field but IBM is a close rival. Applied research is growing and startups are springing up too - it\u2019s possible to book time on a quantum computer hooked up to a cloud server to do research work. China, which has invested heavily in fields such as artificial intelligence, is also backing quantum computing - making it another front in its evolving trade and technology cold war with the United States.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The more qubits that can be strung together, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are quantum computers, and is it time to throw your old PC away?\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat are quantum computers, and is it time to throw your old PC away?\n But there\u2019s a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool the qubits to close to absolute zero to limit vibration \u2014 or \u201cnoise\u201d \u2014 that causes errors to creep into their calculations. It\u2019s in this extremely challenging task that the research team at Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, has made significant progress.CEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.\u201cFor those of us working in science and technology, it\u2019s the \u2018hello world\u2019 moment we\u2019ve been waiting for - the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to date to make quantum computing a reality,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote in a blog. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\nGoogle developed a microprocessor, named Sycamore, that packs a total of 54 qubits.

It solved the problem in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer - the most powerful in the world today \u2014 to solve.\u201cThis dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm,\u201d wrote the research team, led by Google AI\u2019s Frank Arute.While the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT\u2019s William D. Oliver comparing its findings in Nature to the Wright brothers\u2019 first flights, sceptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.Researchers at IBM, Google\u2019s main quantum computing rival, said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days, with greater fidelity \u2014 or accuracy. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nExplained: What is \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019? \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExplained: What is \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019?

      "\nThis NASA image released on October 9, 2019 shows the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP   Astronomers have found a massive galaxy, dating back to the early universe, lurking in cosmic dust clouds\u2013 an advance that may open the doors for discovering a new galaxy population type.The researchers, including those from the University of Massachusetts in the U.S., said the discovery provides new insights into the first steps of some of the biggest galaxies in the universe.\u201cWe figured out that the galaxy is actually a massive monster galaxy, with as many stars as our Milky Way, but brimming with activity and forming new stars at 100 times the rate of our own galaxy,\u201d said study co-author Ivo Labbe from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia. As part of the study, published in the Astrophysical Journal, the researchers used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, or ALMA\u2013 a collection of 66 radio telescopes located in the high mountains of Chile. The lead author of the study, Christina Williams, said she noted a faint blob of light initially.\u201cIt was very mysterious, but the light seemed not to be linked to any known galaxy at all. When I saw this galaxy was invisible at any other wavelength, I got really excited because it meant that it was probably really far away and hidden by clouds of dust,\u201d she said. According to the researchers, the signal came from so far away that it took nearly 12.5 billion years to reach the Earth, when the universe was still in its infancy. The astronomers believe the discovery may solve a long-standing puzzle in astronomy about how some of the biggest galaxies in the early universe appear to have grown and matured very quickly against theoretical predictions.  Additionally, smaller galaxies seen in the early universe with the Hubble space telescope are not growing fast enough, the researchers said. \u201cOur hidden monster galaxy has precisely the right ingredients to be that missing link, because they are probably a lot more common,\u201d said Ms. Williams. The study was carried out in only a tiny part of the sky, less than 1/100th the size of the Moon, the researchers said.  Finding traces of the \u201cmonster\u201d galaxy in a tiny strip of the cosmos, means either that this was a lucky find, or that such galaxies are cloaked and lurking everywhere. Ms. Williams said that she is eager for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to take a look at these cosmic entities once the revolutionary telescope is launched in 2021. \u201cJWST will be able to look through the dust veil so we can learn how big these galaxies really are and how fast they are growing, to better understand why models fail in explaining them,\u201d she said.

      "\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again appearing before Congress to face questions about his company\u2019s massive market power, privacy lapses and tolerance of speech deemed false or hateful.Mr. Zuckerberg has been summoned to testify at a hearing on Wednesday by the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s plan to create a global digital currency, which has stirred opposition from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe. But the full range of policies and conduct of the social media giant with nearly 2.5 billion users will be under the public glare.It\u2019s the Facebook chief\u2019s first testimony to Congress since April 2018.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook's Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFacebook's Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing The company seems to spark public and official anger at every turn these days, from its shift into messaging services that allow encrypted conversations to its alleged anticompetitive behavior to its refusal to take down phony political ads or doctored videos.Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have criticized Facebook\u2019s plan for the new currency, to be called Libra. They warn that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking.Rep. Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the Financial Services panel, this summer asked Facebook to not move forward with the currency and a digital wallet called Calibra that would be used with it. Waters has called Libra \u201ca new Swiss-based financial system\u201d that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.Several high-profile companies that had signed on as partners in Facebook\u2019s governing association for Libra have recently bailed, spelling a potentially rough road for the project. But many experts don\u2019t believe it\u2019s doomed.Mr. Zuckerberg, in written testimony prepared for the hearing, aimed to reassure lawmakers that his company won\u2019t try to evade financial regulators as it readies Libra.Facebook \u201cwill not be a part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world unless all U.S. regulators approve it,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a stronger statement than Facebook official David Marcus made to Congress in July, when he said the company will not activate Libra until it has \u201cfully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.\u201d Mr. Marcus leads the Libra project.Mr. Zuckerberg is striving to defend Libra and alleviate concerns that the currency could sidestep regulators. Analysts say Libra could avoid regulation and launch in countries where it\u2019s not getting pushback, but this doesn\u2019t appear to be Facebook\u2019s intention.Instead, Mr. Zuckerberg is pushing an optimistic vision of Libra and what it could mean for people around the world who don\u2019t have access to bank accounts.While some critics see the recent exodus of some Libra partners as evidence of the plan\u2019s likely failure, U.S. regulators appear to view it as enough of a threat that they are considering the possibility of the Fed launching its own competitor currency.\u201cAt the Federal Reserve, we will continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies, and look forward to learning from other central banks,\u201d Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, said in a speech last week.There is concern among regulators that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.Mr. Zuckerberg also played the China card in his remarks, urging regulators to act quickly. \u201cWhile we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months,\u201d he said.The Facebook CEO also has cited competition from China as a compelling reason against breaking up the company.The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other huge tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, has advocated breaking up Facebook and other tech behemoths. She recently ran a fake political ad on Facebook taking aim at Mr. Zuckerberg to protest the company\u2019s policy of not fact-checking politicians\u2019 speech or ads in the same way it enlists outside parties to fact-check news stories and other posts.In a major speech last week at Georgetown University, Mr. Zuckerberg defended the company\u2019s refusal to take down content from its platform it considers newsworthy \u201ceven if it goes against our standards.\u201dFacebook, Google and Twitter are trying to oversee Internet content while also avoiding infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nMahendra Singh Dhoni is expected to watch the first day of the India-South Africa third Test in Ranchi on October 19, 2019.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nPTI\n An online search for cricketer M.S. Dhoni has the highest possibility of taking you to malicious websites, a cybersecurity company\u2019s study said on Tuesday. Other Indian celebrities in the list, whose names are used to lure unsuspecting fans to such websites, include actors Radhika Apte and Shraddha Kapoor, sportsperson P.V. Sindhu and also former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, the list prepared by McAfee said. Netizens often look for free and pirated content such as sports events, movies, TV shows, and images of their favourite superstars. Unfortunately, they may not be aware of the risks that malicious websites providing such content can pose, Venkat Krishnapur, its managing director for India, said.Mr. Krishnapur added the ease of access through multiple devices has also made it easy for the users to go on various websites to look for content they want. Dhoni and Tendulkar occupy the top honours in the Dangerous Celebrity list and the company attributed this to cricketers being larger than life personalities whose names resonate with lifestyle and entertainment audiences. Adult movie star turned Bollywood actor Sunny Leone is fourth on the list, behind reality show winning TV actor Gautam Gulati, the survey said. In what should cause concern, it said as the young, digital native population continues to spend more time online due to cheaper data and smart devices, they will continue to remain soft targets for cybercriminals who thrive on such user behavior. It has advised users to be careful on what they click, wait for the official release of content on safe websites rather than opting for third party ones, refrain from using illegal streaming sites, and use widely available security products to save themselves.

      "\nFile photo shows apps for WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and other social networks on a smartphone \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n \u00a0The Supreme Court has decided to examine whether social media intermediaries such as Facebook and WhatsApp should facilitate the State to access encrypted and private conversations of citizens, purportedly to fight crime and terror.A Bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose on Tuesday transferred to itself several pending cases in various High Courts on the issue and scheduled the hearing for January 2020 last week before an appropriate Bench.The court is waiting for the Centre to notify the revised Information Technology Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules by January 15. These Rules, said the government, were borne out of the present day neeed to usher in a stricter regime and more cooperation to combat the spread of pornography, sedition, hate, fake news, \u201canti-national activities and terror\u201d online.Justice Bose said the issue concerned individual privacy versus national interest.\u201cA terrorist cannot claim privacy,\u201d submitted Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal, along with Tamil Nadu Advocate General Vijay Narayan and Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan.\u00a0Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta said the government\u2019s move to gain more access into social media was not a \u201cploy\u201d and was triggered by a deep concern for the sovereignty of the nation. It was stemmed out of national interest.\u201cThe government has no intention to invade the privacy of innocents,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. Intermediaries should cooperate with the government to secure the nation against terror. \u201cYour Lordships have to find a balance between national interest, sovereignty and police investigation with individual privacy.\u201d\u00a0Mr. Mehta was reacting to submissions made by senior advocate Shyam Divan, for Internet Freedom Foundation, that the case was momentous and affected personal freedom. \u201cThe rights of citizens cannot be trampled upon,\u201d Mr. Divan submitted.Mr. Venugopal said Parliament had empowered the government through Section 69 (1) of the Information Technology Act to lawfully intercept, monitor and decrypt information through a computer resource if \u201csatisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or for investigation of any offence\u201d.Mr. Venugopal argued, \u201cNow social media intermediaries can\u2019t come into the country and say they can\u2019t allow decryption.\u201dJustice Gupta remarked that the Section only allowed the government to lawfully decrypt information and did not entail any obligation on the part of the social intermediary concerned.Mr. Venugopal responded that the government did not want any technical assistance from the intermediary to crack encrypted social media traffic to fight crime. All it wanted was for the online platforms to facilitate access. \u201cThey will give us facilities to access the information, to access the entire counter system in which they are recording,\u201d he submitted.\u201cNot so simple. I don\u2019t have the key,\u201d senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for WhatsApp, responded to the argument.Justice Bose said the hardware may be located outside the country.\u201cLet them say so, we will take care of that,\u201d Mr. Venugopal replied.Mr. Rohatgi said the social media intermediaries were under no obligation to disclose details of private accounts. This would breach privacy.Justice Bose put matters in perspective, saying the social intermediaries could not claim protection under the fundamental rights of 19(1)(a) and (g) \u2014 right to free speech and right to practise any profession. \u201cYou are not an Indian citizen,\u201d he explained.\u201cI am not on my protection but on the protection of the rights of my clients [social media account holders],\u201d Mr. Rohatgi clarified.In a recent affidavit, the government said Internet had emerged as a potent tool to cause unimaginable disruption to the democratic polity.The affidavit was explaining to the apex court the need to revise rules to regulate social media intermediaries. The affidavit filed by the\u00a0Ministry of Information Technology said the regulatory regime required to be ramped up, considering the \u201cever-growing threats to individual rights and nation\u2019s integrity, sovereignty and security\u201d.The court hearing was based on a petition filed by Facebook for transfer of pleas concerning the linking of social media accounts to Aadhaar. Facebook and WhatsApp have argued that this would lead to loss of individual privacy. The Tamil Nadu government \u2014 one of the cases is pending in the Madras High Court \u2014 has argued that social media should be more transparent and cooperative with the police for purposes of crime detection, national security and so on.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "It will be the chant of a broken record player to say our eyes are more strained on a daily basis than they were 10 years ago. Gadgets have created ecosystems that suck us in from one screen to the other; phones ring on your laptop, your messages are delivered to your tablet, all this even as you are browsing Instagram on your phone, occasionally distracted by your smartwatch reminding you to stand up and take a few steps.SpecificationsPower: DC 5V 1ADimensions and weight: 208mm x 76mm x 106mm; 318 gModes: Sleep Mode (10 mins), Medium Mode (15 mins), Hard Mode (20 mins)Given we are saturated by exposure to blue and dark screens, ultimate self-care now must involve eye massages. At least this has been my takeaway since trying the Breo iSee4 \u2014 even if the device leaves me a little disappointed.The iSee4 wins in looks; adequately heavy, meaning that it is employing all that we like about a gravity blanket \u2014 the comfort of gentle weight on aching and tired parts of us, but does so while looking like a state-of-the-art AR device. If you are doing this in front of others, you are only bound to feel as foolish as the first time you tried the Google Cardboard... but at least this is cushioned.The puffing sounds from the air bags, as they snugly press into your temples and the balls of your closed eyelids might feel weird at first, but end up being therapeutic \u2014 perhaps reminiscent of little exhalations.The warm compress starts slow, having your eyes adjust to the temperature delicately. I have always found the suggestion to rub your palms till they warm up and then press them to your closed eyes, a little pointless. You would need to have cried all night for this to have any effect. The iSee4\u2019s warm compress, however, starts only after working the area a little \u2014 the gentle air bags shift with varying pressure across the eyes and temples, making the warmth actually soothing.There are only three modes on the device. A long-press powers the system on, by default into the Sleep Mode, and then there is Medium Mode and Hard Mode. These are displayed on a small LCD screen at the side. The latter two modes come with music while only the last mode comes with a vibration. To toggle between modes, you short-press the button, and to power off, you long-press again.iSee4 is also quite travel-friendly, given that it folds in half from the point where it sits on your nose. It does not flatten fully, but is compact enough. The strap is adjustable if you are sharing the device, and the cushioned section is low-maintenance; simply wipe with cotton soaked in alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy disappointment was primarily the audible dull motor sound, reminding you that this machine is working overtime to make you feel good. I am immediately distracted and already exhausted at its effort. If the makers have deliberately left this on, so as to mimic a sort of white or brown noise experience, it did not work for me.Also the music... if you are stressed and tired, this will annoy you; listen to it more than once, and you might as well be Alex from A Clockwork Orange. The sound alters between chirping birds, crickets, dripping water, and something resembling an ocean wave. The problem, though, is the short looping so that you can tell where each starts and ends. Think of this as an audio equivalent of a GIF or Boomerang, as opposed to a seamless easing into hypnosis.Clearly, with the addition of sound, Breo was going for a multi-sensory experience. With the proliferation of well-produced relaxing audio on meditation apps, this is a little lazy and left me feeling short-changed.While quantitatively, the pros outweigh the cons, the latter are quite an important part of the experience. I wish I had the option to turn the music on the Medium Mode and off the Hard Mode. More importantly, I wish the device were quieter \u2014 this doesn\u2019t seem like much to ask in 2019. If there is an option to try this device out (with hygienic measures) in-store before making a purchase, do try it before making a purchase.Available on Flipkart, GlobalKart and Bed Bath & Beyond starting at \u20b96,000You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRahul Bose at the Partition Museum\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n During his presentations on Mahatma Gandhi, A Annamalai, the Director of National Gandhi Museum (NGM), Delhi, often asks the audience: \u201cDo you think the textile mill workers were happy with Gandhi when he visited them in Lancashire in 1931?\u201d\u201cThey usually respond, \u2018No\u2019. Since the Indian National Congress had called for the boycott of British goods that led to the closure of textile mills, the audience feels Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have been welcomed. So, I show them the video of Gandhi being cheered by the textile mill workers. The audience is surprised and see for themselves what really happened,\u201d says Annamalai, adding that the audiovisual presentations help him construct an image of Gandhi for the younger generation.October 27 is the World Day for Audiovisual (AV) Heritage, instituted by UNESCO to create awareness on the significance of heritage preservation of this nature, to clear the misconception that museums are static. Vijayawada\u2019s Bapu Museum has adopted AR and VR with AV elements to engender participation from visitors. But let us talk classic audio-visual heritage; it is far less manufactured and delineates authentic preservation culture of classic media forms.Annamalai vouches for the medium. In addition to documents, photographs, and objects, NGM has 100 hours of recordings related to Gandhi, including AK Chettiar\u2019s 1941 documentary Mahatma Gandhi \u2013 20th Century Prophet.For a long time, Chettiar\u2019s film was untraceable. It was available in its original 15 MM format but couldn\u2019t be screened as the format had become redundant. The film was digitised in 2014 in 4K.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Gandhi Museum in Delhi\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Partition Museum in Amritsar has hundreds of stories of its survivors. \u201cWe have collected thousands of oral histories. They are the stories of the generation who lived through it. As this generation is getting old, there is a need to document their experiences and record their memories,\u201d says Mallika Ahluwalia, the museum\u2019s co-founder and CEO.The museum also has archival footage of the trains, kafilas, and camps during the Partition. The oldest AV material in the museum is footage from the freedom struggle from around 1920, covering the Non-Cooperation movement and the Khilafat movement.To the museum, audiovisual technology not just offers solutions to document history, but also an opportunity to have a deeper engagement with the visitors. For example, the recording of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s \u2018Amar Shonar Bangla\u2019, which was written in the aftermath of the 1905 Partition of Bengal, plays in the museum\u2019s \u2018Resistance\u2019 gallery.In order to upskill its employees, Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (IGRMS) in Bhopal recently organised an eight-day audio-visual workshop \u2018Towards an Audio-Visual Museum.\u2019 The principle role of digital documentation and maintaining digital archives, among other things, were discussed. Such workshops are important for the museum, which has about 10,000 hours of AV archives. \u201cResearch and education being a mandate for IGRMS, we need to share authentic information about various tribal and folk communities. Our audio-visual collections are mostly ethnographic and are recorded or captured directly from the field as well as from in-house activities,\u201d says Dilip Singh, joint director, IGRMS.Indian Music Experience (IME) in Bengaluru is an interactive museum and uses AV material innovatively. For instance, the section on kaavads, a wooden portable shrine used by storytellers, is accompanied by a documentary on the subject by Neena Sabnani.\n\n\n\n\n\nManasi Prasad, Carnatic singer and director of Indian Music Experience\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nK Bhagya Prakash\n \n\n\n\n\nIn another gallery, an auto-rickshaw has been turned into a mini-theatre, with films on indie bands playing inside. Samay Chakra is an immersive piece, wherein the overhead screen displays the time of the day, and the Hindustani raga alluding to that hour is played. The lyrics of a bandish composed in that raga also appears in one of the screens.Manasi Prasad, director of IME, raises concerns regarding copyright issues and aggrandisement of technology. \u201cOne issue that the entire world of audiovisual archives is facing right now is getting permissions. The rights of a recording lie with all the people involved. So it becomes difficult to ascertain who it belongs to. In terms of technology, it requires institutions to have a robust digital infrastructure to withstand changes.\u201dPrasad also points out the need for sufficient funds to maintain proper infrastructure and hire competent staff. \u201cSometimes people don\u2019t consider audiovisual material as valuable as an artefact. They feel it is just a recording. Just because it is intangible doesn\u2019t mean it is not valuable,\u201d she adds.ChallengesDestructions of the National Museum of Natural History in Delhi and the National Museum of Brazil in a fire have served as important lessons to museum administrators like Mallika. The latter had also lost some rare recordings among its precious assets. \u201cThe bulk of our collection is video and to make sure it is safe, we need to keep it in different formats and different places,\u201d explains Mallika.According to Vinod Daniel, Chair of AusHeritage and Board Member of the International Council of Museums, weather conditions are also detrimental to the safety of the audio-visual material. Annamalai feels that technology is a double-edged sword. \u201cThe technology that is allowing us to make this content available can also be used to fake it. First of all, we should digitise retaining the originality and always keep the original. After we created this pen-drive, a lot of people call or mail us to authenticate.\u201dIt is indeed a heritage that is being preserved by organisations like National Cultural Audiovisual Archives (NCAA), Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts. In its pilot phase that ends this year, NCAA has partnered with 30 institutions across India and built over 31,000 hours of audio and video content. In the next five years, NCAA has set a target of over 3.5 lakh hours of digitisation and an expanded network of partnering institutions.On its audiovisual documentation work, Irfan Zuberi, project manager of NCAA, says, \u201cThey are valuable tools for piecing together several endangered or perhaps even extinct aspects of our shared heritage. For instance, recordings of legendary musicians continue to inspire current performers. That is how archival content can be relevant and become an integral part of current practice.\u201d The oldest recording in its repository is a silent colour film from the collection of National Archives of India, depicting the immersion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948.Irfan feels that in today\u2019s scenario, the work of NCAA assumes more relevance. \u201cGiven technological obsolescence, there is a tight time window globally for playback of old formats of audio and video recordings, after which it would become nearly impossible to either find new playback machines or spare parts to repair existing playback machines. Thus, it is extremely important for analog audiovisual content to be migrated to digital file formats within the next 10 years.\u201dAccording to Irfan, the long-term preservation of digital content throws up challenges too. \u201cThe digital data has to be constantly checked for integrity, accuracy, and completeness at regular intervals and this is one of the key technical tasks performed by the NCAA, which has emerged as the world\u2019s first Trustworthy Digital Repository.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) told the top court that though technology had led to economic growth and societal development, there was also an exponential rise in hate speech, fake news and anti-national activities. Photo for representation purpose only.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nK.V. Srinivasan\n Internet has emerged as a potent tool that can cause unimaginable disruption to the democratic polity, the government has told the Supreme Court.The Ministry of Information Technology said in an affidavit that rules to regulate social media intermediaries needed to be revised. The regulatory regime had to be ramped up considering the \u201cever-growing threats to individual rights and the nation\u2019s integrity, sovereignty, and security.\u201dIt said the new Information Technology Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules would be notified by January 15, 2020. The affidavit was in response to a September 24 order of the court to appraise it of the status of framing of the new rules and the timeline for their notification.The order came on a petition filed by the social media giant Facebook for transfer of pleas concerning the linking of social media accounts to Aadhaar. Social media intermediaries like Facebook and WhatsApp have argued that this would lead to loss of individual privacy. The Tamil Nadu government \u2014 one of the cases is pending in the Madras High Court \u2014 has argued that the social media should be more transparent and cooperative with the police for purposes of crime detection, national security, etc.The Centre said Internet had led to development, but it had also been a platform for spreading hate and fake news. Internet had led to an exponential rise in \u201canti-national activities.\u201dThe government said in the \u201clast few years there has been an enormous increase in the use of social media, and with lower Internet tariffs, availability of smart devices and last-mile connectivity, more and more people in India are becoming part of the Internet/social media platforms.\u201d\u201cIf on the one hand technology has led to economic growth and societal development, on the other hand there has been an exponential rise in hate speech, fake news, public order, anti-national activities, defamatory postings, and other unlawful activities using Internet/social media platforms,\u201d the Centre told the apex court.The government said Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had addressed the Rajya Sabha on July 26 last year on the issue of misuse of social media platform and propagation of fake news. He had assured the House that the government would initiate a number of measures, including amendments in the existing Intermediaries Guidelines Rules, 2011, to make intermediaries more liable for the content that was published, transmitted, etc, on their platforms.The government said detailed discussions were on at various levels, including inter-ministerial, as the issue was complex and concerned the functioning of netizens, government departments/ministries, social media platforms, messaging platforms, websites and mobile apps. The government said efforts were on to make the Rules \u201ceffective, robust and comprehensive.\u201dThe case is scheduled to be heard on October 22.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University, on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Washington. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n A defiant Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stressed that his platform has now become a \u2018Fifth Estate\u2019 in the world alongside traditional news media and people no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard.Delivering a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, DC on Thursday, he said social media platforms have decentralised power by putting it directly into people\u2019s hands.\u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world \u2014 a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, apparently challenging those who wish to break up the social networking giant. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Luther King's daughter tells Facebook disinformation helped kill civil rights leader\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMartin Luther King's daughter tells Facebook disinformation helped kill civil rights leader\nSenators and presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are pitching hard to break up Facebook, amid regulators scrutinising the company over anti-competitive practices and privacy scandals.\u201cPeople no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences,\u201d he added.\u201cI understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralised power, but I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralised power by putting it directly into people\u2019s hands. It\u2019s part of this amazing expansion of voice through law, culture and technology,\u201d the Facebook CEO elaborated.Mr. Zuckerberg also said the company does not fact-check political ads.\u201cWe don\u2019t fact-check political ads. We don\u2019t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. And if content is newsworthy, we also won\u2019t take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards,\u201d he said.\u201cOf course there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don\u2019t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm \u2014 and of course we don\u2019t allow voter suppression. Voting is voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg added.In an apparent embarrassment for Facebook, Ms. Warren run a fake ad on the social media platform that claimed \u201cMark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election\u201d.Unhappy over Facebook\u2019s announcement that it exempts politicians\u2019 posts from third-party fact-checking, the Massachusetts Senator intentionally made the ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved.\u201cIt got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. It changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies \u2014 explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes,\u201d Ms. Warren had tweeted.Mr. Zuckerberg replied to Ms. Warren in his speech: \u201cI know many people disagree, but, in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we\u2019re not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads\u201d.\u201cPolitical ads are an important part of voice \u2014 especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favours incumbents and whoever the media covers,\u201d he added.Even if we wanted to ban political ads, he said, it\u2019s not clear where we would draw the line.\u201cThere are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women\u2019s empowerment? If we banned candidates\u2019 ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves?\u201d argued Mr. Zuckerberg.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " Facebook on Wednesday announced the second phase of its \u2018GOAL\u2019 initiative under which the social networking giant is helping tribal girls from across India to become village-level digital young leaders for their communities. The second phase of the programme \u2014 launched by Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda \u2014 will digitally mentor 5,000 young women in India\u2019s tribal dominated districts. Launched earlier this year in March, Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) connects underprivileged young women from tribal areas with senior expert mentors in the areas of business, fashion and arts to learn digital and life skills.\u201cThrough this partnership, the GOAL programme will provide economically and socially marginalised young women with the tools and guidance they need to succeed, using technology they may otherwise have not had access to,\u201d Mr. Munda said. The initiative will include weekly one-to-one mentoring sessions that focus on a range of skills such as digital literacy, entrepreneurship and online safety. Overall, more than 2,00,000 hours of guidance will be provided using Facebook family of apps including WhatsApp and Messenger. Following the programme, the participants will graduate to the GOAL alumni and will continue to receive support and guidance from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Facebook. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs will also work with district administration and other government agencies to help secure qualified participants with a fellowship, so they can put their newly learned skills to work. More than 125 young women have enrolled for the programme. Facebook India Head Ajit Mohan said about 30-35% of women in India have access to Internet in India.\u201cWe are committed to investing in ways to address this gap and bring the power of Internet to more women in India,\u201d he added. Facebook India Director of Policy Ankhi Das said this programme is important because it actively supports these young women to build leadership qualities and encourages them to be champions and help share their learnings with others.

As far as Pixel 4 goes, this model has to be one of the most leaked smartphones in recent history; everything from specs to design were out on the global table\u2026 and for a while now, the Internet has been brimming with multiple detailed hands-on videos.The device, priced at $799, is to be released across major markets on October 24 \u2013 except India. According to an official spokesperson at Google, the Pixel 4 \u201cGoogle has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features. We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\u201dSo what are we missing here? There are three colours for the models: Just Black, Clearly White, and a limited edition Oh So Orange. They now also have a rear dual-camera system, which isn\u2019t much of a surprise. The Pixel 4 features a 5.7-inch display, while the Pixel 4 XL has a 6.3-inch screen. What Google dubs \u2018Smooth Displays\u2019 come with a refresh rate of 90Hz (which has been the talk of many tech brands such as OnePlus), a first for any Pixel phone\u2026 but this could do more harm than good considering there isn\u2019t much of an upgrade in the Pixel 4 series\u2019 battery life. The phones could up the RAM from 4GB to 6GB this time around. The Pixel 4 series is fuelled by the Snapdragon 855 SoC, rather than the on-trend 855 Plus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Google Pixel 4 smartphones are displayed during a Google launch event in New York City, New York, U.S.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nReuters\n \n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant is also said to be far more deeply embedded in the OS (Android 10 out of the box for this one), meaning more intuitive and speedy responses when interacting with the device. One of the newest features for the Pixel 4 series is that it claims to have the fastest face unlock system on any smartphone; fingers point to the company\u2019s new motion-sensing Soli chip next to the front-facing camera sensor. For the Pixel 4 series, Google\u2019s omitted the strategically-placed fingerprint sensor, replacing the security features with facial recognition unlock and basic PIN entry. The camera, one of Pixel\u2019s highest selling points, has undergone a further boost with astrophotography facilities, learning-based white balancing features and a wider range Portrait mode. Then there\u2019s the new Live HDR+ which will let users preview HDR+ processing in the camera app before taking the photo, and the Dual Exposure controls which gives users the power to adjust shadows and highlights in a shot before taking the photo.That said, it doesn\u2019t seem like the lack of availability of the Pixel 4 will keep Google loyalists or new demographics from finding ways to buy the phone.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Fortnite raked in $2.4 billion in revenue in 2018, more than any other single title, according to Nielsen data.The runaway successes of the games prompted Electronic Arts to launch its similarly-themed Apex Legends earlier this year and competition continues to mount.The mobile version of Activision's long-running \u201dCall of Duty\u201d franchise launched on Oct. 1, and has already racked up 125 million unique downloads and more than $28 million in gross player spending, according to data website SensorTower.Shares in Activision, EA and Grand Theft Auto-maker Take-Two Interactive Software all inched higher in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Fortnite publisher Epic was worth $15 billion when it last raised capital from investors last year.

      "\nNew York-based comic artist Nathan W Pyle at the 2019 Hyderabad leg of Comic India at Hitex Exhibition Centre \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani   Comic Con India made the right choice by placing Nathan W Pyle\u2019s Strange Planet booth close to the front of 2000-pax capacity Hitex\u2019s Exhibition Hall last weekend... However, the space around the booth wasn\u2019t big enough for the hundreds who flocked to get autographed posters from the illustrator. Each fan, having waited about 20 minutes to meet Nathan, enthusiastically told him how the blue beings\u2019 invasion of their social media feeds cheers them up.Fortunately, the MetroPlus interview with Nathan is in a quiet room, scheduled ahead of his meeting with Strange Planet fans, away from the floor-thumping bass of music, video games and spontaneous announcements.Nathan and his wife Taylor aren\u2019t strangers to Comic Cons; they just finished up at New York \u2014 one of the biggest comic conventions in the world. The excitement continues for the couple as this is not just their first trip to India, but also a chance to interact with a different sphere of creativity and a diverse fan-base. The success story of Strange Planet is remarkable given it launched only in February 2019 and Nathan\u2019s Instagram account now has over 4.3 million followers. The comics are unique in that the doe-eyed blue beings that star in them have neither race nor gender. They also speak in a charming, if mind-bending version of English. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the posts from \u2018Strange Planet\u2019 by Nathan W Pyle. This comic is from October 11, titled \u2018s t r i k i n g\u2019 \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nNathan W Pyle  \n\n\n\n\nOn the morning Nathan landed in India, the Strange Planet Instagram post titled \u2018striking\u2019 shows a boxing lesson between blue beings, which they term \u201crecreational face striking.\u201d In the same post, push-ups are labelled \u201clet-downs.\u201d Then there is the much-craved \u201cstar damage,\u201d a very literal take on sun tans. Thanks to today\u2019s infinite scroll culture, it is easy to find yourself chuckling at the beings\u2019 quotidian antics without realising you have probably gone through months\u2019 worth of content. \u201cLanguage is at the heart of Strange Planet\u2019s humour,\u201d says Nathan, \u201cand it is neat that everywhere you go, English is used but differently \u2014 especially because language is elastic and evolving. It is a spice to help create a new experience. See, we don\u2019t use the word \u2018sustenance\u2019 as much these days, but in Strange Planet, it can sound futuristic \u2014 irony!\u201d He is alluding to his September 17 post \u2018affirm\u2019 where a character is \u201cunsure of which sustenance to purchase.\u201d Pageturner Nathan\u2019s book Strange Planet will launch in late November, courtesy Hachette India. The book will feature never-before-seen comics and more two-part comics. \u201cIt was hard to condense all I\u2019ve created into this singular book, but would love to create more of larger story.\u201dLike every creator out there, Nathan has a method to his madness, and his approach to visual design requires balance. The lines of Strange Planet are simple and the colours in each comic are minimal. \u201cWe want for the words to be legible so I do clear a lot of space. Maybe a character will be pushed to the side but the words are important. In some comics, even where characters are doing a lot of physical exertion, they don\u2019t have added muscle.\u201d Creating content for the digital space is largely a win for Nathan. \u201cThere is a malleability online; as creators, we can post when we want to and directly communicate with audiences. On Facebook, I post the comic in black-and-white while Instagram gets colour versions; this is deliberate in case I want to tweak anything language-wise for the Instagram version while adding colour.\u201d Nathan does not want to remove the mystique of what these adorable characters actually sound like in his head. Does he speak like them sometimes? Taylor smirks a little, explaining, \u201cSometimes we will be walking around New York City and he will be like this [Closes her eyes, tilts her head back a little and shakes her hands loosely at her sides, to which Nathan laughs], and that is when he is clearly creating what the beings are saying. I can tell he will be talking like they are.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nNew York-based comic artist Nathan W Pyle signing comic posters for fans at the 2019 Hyderabad leg of Comic India at Hitex Exhibition Centre \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n \n\n\n\n\nNathan tacks on, \u201cWell, it has been 238 days in a row that I have posted a comic. So with that output of a comic a day, Taylor is definitely hearing out my ideas \u2014 a beta audience, if you will.... she is very honest and has shot down a few ideas too!\u201d It is no secret that Hyderabad is amok with pigeons. So when Nathan and Taylor observed the same at Golconda Fort, Nathan instantly got to filming videos of pigeons for his other equally-intriguing Instagram account \u2018Pigeons by Nathan\u2019 which chronicles the oddities of these birds. \u201cHyderabad pigeons are more fit and friendly than New York pigeons which are more aggressive,\u201d observes Nathan, \u201c\u2018Pigeons by Nathan helps me when I am stuck creatively; I will watch the way pigeons interact and form a story out of it, because they are all different in movement and character... and Taylor is very patient with that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan W Pyle\u2019s \u2018Strange Planet\u2019 usually has positive spirits around love and acceptance \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nNathan W Pyle\n \n\n\n\n\nTaylor jokes, \u201cI am okay in the summer... but then there\u2019s the four-degree Fahrenheit winters when he is filming pigeons.\u201d Given a large portion of fans are Indian, Nathan says early conversations with Comic Con India founder Jatin Varma were encouraging. He says, \u201cThere are obviously some brands [Taylor and I] know and then there are ones we don\u2019t know. We are not just looking forward to knowing more about entertainment in Hyderabad but also within the comics space. In Hyderabad, there is a real appreciation for technology and for food too.\u201d He says he had \u201clentil doughnut\u201d for breakfast (vada), that that they dined at Ohri\u2019s the day before. He adds that he is looking for some authentic Hyderabadi biryani next."

      "It is perfectly natural to confuse the new GRID with the 2014 reboot of the famous TOCA Race Driver series, Race Driver: Grid. GRIDDeveloper + Publisher: CodemastersPrice: \u20b93499 PlayStation 4Codemasters has sort of shot itself in the foot with the reboot of Race Driver: Grid by simply renaming it GRID. Naming qualms aside, GRID is a fine racing game that deserves its spot with the Forza and Gran Turismo series.What is it about?The previous instalments in the Grid series were competent racing games with a slight arcade slant. But they were always a step behind the other racing games. The 2019 GRID changes all that as it takes a page from Forza\u2019s Horizon series. Codemasters has created a veritable experience for us to dive into. How does it play?If Forza was clean and fun, GRID is dirty, competitive, and rough. And, I love it. You race in exotic locales, but they aren\u2019t picture perfect \u2014 you have to deal with the glare of lights, the chaos of the snarling engines and the dirt kicked up by the vehicles as opponents play dirty. \n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, there is a rewind button that is generous with how far it can undo your previous actions.There is a plethora of licensed cars to choose from, all with their distinct handling styles. There are also several types of races, like rallies, stock car racing and street racing in a wide variety of tracks. The game looks gorgeous in a grungy kind of way with a real racing feel to everything, right down to the scuffs of paint on the weary cars. Should you get it?If you\u2019re on the lookout for an excellent racer, you can\u2019t go wrong with GRID. Just make sure you get the correct one. Are you one of those FIFA fans screaming out for a new FIFA Street for the longest time? It is here in the form of the new VOLTA mode in FIFA 20, which exists alongside the professional soccer part that the series has been known for. FIFA 20Developer + Publisher: EA SportsPrice: \u20b93999 PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, SwitchDoes this right brain, left brain situation work for or against the 2020 edition?What is it about?The highlight of FIFA 20 is VOLTA, the game\u2019s street soccer mode. The game allows you to play local football as well as compete in large stadiums around the globe. It dips heavily into football culture, while creating a narrative, which is engaging enough to keep your fingers away from the skip button.How does it play?\n\n\n\n\n\nFans who have been playing the game year after year may not notice the subtle changes. But those who are picking up the game after a long break will be delighted with the way the game gets the ball physics and natural player motions right. Unanimously, though, the biggest standout is the challenge posed by the artificial intelligence. VOLTA on its own is an excellent addition, but much of the game\u2019s efforts have gone into crafting the trick system. The style additions add a Fortnite-like flair to the game, as you kit out your players and go online in search of formidable opponents to fight through seasons and unlock more style items. Should you get it?FIFA 20 isn\u2019t drastically different from its predecessor. But if you want to take the game to the streets, the VOLTA in FIFA 20 is well worth it.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\niPhone 11 and 11 Pro: Apple\u2019s true flagships are finally here \n",
      "Updated: October 14, 2019 17:29 IST\rPublished: October 14, 2019 16:52 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-iphone-11-and-iphone-11-pro-2019-apples-true-flagships-tenacious-battery-life-a-triple-camera-system-a-faster-and-intuitive-a13-bionic-chipset/article29681013.ece",
      "\nThe iPhone 11 Pro in gold and the iPhone 11 in purple, which were the review devices\n\u00a0 The unveiling of the iPhone 11 series was a pretty exciting moment for Apple and for iPhone-lovers, for various reasons from the upgraded camera system to the intricate functions of the A13 Bionic chip. I\u2019ve got to say, unboxing iPhones has gotten a tad anticlimactic for the amount of paper used in the packaging. While one can say \u2018just send it all for recycling\u2019, there are still a population of tech loyalists who hold on to the box for as long as they do the gadget itself.When you finally hold the iPhone 11 Pro, the more tactile feel of it, thanks to the angelic matte finish on the back, is a pleasant break away from the glass-backed previous models. A touch of glam for the 11 Pro comes with the chrome detailing around the edges, too, catching the light just right\u2014 a welcome break from the holographic phones which permeated concepts of smartphone design this year.iPhone 11 SpecsDimensions: 5.94\u201d x 2.98\u201d x 0.33\u201d; 194 gDisplay: Liquid Retina HD; 6.1\u201d LCD display; 1400:1 contrast ratio (typical); 2436-by-1125-pixel resolution at 458 ppi; 625 nits max brightness (typical)Materials & finishes: Aluminium and glass finishWater resistance: Water resistant to a depth of 2 metres for up to 30 minutesiPhone 11 is available in 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models in six colours, starting at \u20b964,900.iPhone 11 series is the vivid and non-grainy display, especially in Dark Mode. Keep in mind that earlier models had an upper parameter of 625 nits of brightness, while the 11 Pro dazzles at 800 nits of maximum brightness for the typical display and 1,200 nits of maximum brightness for HDR experiences, such as gaming and streaming. The 11 models come in the iconic throwback shades of the early Apple logo, my review device being an easy-on-the-eyes purple hue. The rear dual-camera system is the noticeable difference between its big brother the 11 Pro, so obviously the latter is more of a conversation-starter; throwback to the memes of the induction stove-top-like rear triple-camera system.My heart breaks for the screen durability \u2014 or lack thereof. The 11 series claims to have the toughest screens out there... but after a couple of days in my possession \u2014 and I like to think I\u2019m pretty careful about my gadgets \u2014 there was a noticeable scratch on the screen. Come to think of it, I\u2019ve rarely had this issue with Apple, except for the rare hard fall, which saw a total shatter.In 2019, this really shouldn\u2019t be an issue with new phones, considering screen durability has been perfected by countless names in the market.Apple made a clever move by making sure the new iOS 13 is best harnessed by the 11 series, which is equipped with the new A13 Bionic chip. The intuitive operating system platform keeps its wits about itself with regard to charging and will even curtail the power input at the right times. However, the phone did heat up, particularly during app updates, gaming and FaceTime.So, let us talk A13 Bionic: Apple\u2019s new chipset. Making the 11 series fluid, A13 definitely lives up to its promise of being far more instinctive to make sure you get the best out of your phone right till the last percentile of battery life, whether you are FaceTiming, or video-editing during which the changes you make reflect live \u2014 no more waiting and lags.The battery for the 11 series is certainly \u2018bae\u2019. Charging is silly fast, I no longer have to worry about a night-time charge, I just power up first thing in the morning before the office run. Wireless charging is available too, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you are short on time. I also found myself relying less on a back-up battery which used to be habitual when using earlier models. A few weeks into using the phone, I spent four hours continuously recording videos, taking countless pictures, audio-recording interviews and live-tweeting. I\u2019d started with a full battery and ended with a 64% battery. However, I feel that Google, Samsung and Xiaomi have nailed the efficient battery formula, which has retained their own loyal investors. As Vanessa Williams sang, I\u2019ve saved the best for last. The intelligent camera systems of the 11 series are a delight to work and play with. True Depth is bettered in the 11 series, where portraits are less blurry and focussing is more sustained. I\u2019ve already taken an embarrassing number of Slo-Fies (slow-motion selfies) in which the quality is pretty great. But if we\u2019re getting into the anatomy of Portrait modes, Google Pixel is in the lead here for detail and less fuss.The Ultra Wide lens, offering \u0192/2.4 aperture plus a 120-degree field of view, is ideal for photographing wide scapes of pretty scenery or tight shots in small spaces. Ultra Wide basically makes the most of A13 Bionic\u2019s machine learning capabilities in that it takes a decent approximation of the subject\u2019s environment.iPhone 11 Pro SpecsDimensions: 5.67\u201d x 2.81\u201d x 0.32\u201d; 188 gDisplay: Super Retina XDR; 5.8\u201d OLED display; 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio (typical); 1792-by-828-pixel resolution at 326 ppi; 800 nits max brightness (typical)Materials & finishes: Stainless steel and glass finishWater resistance: Water resistant to a depth of 4 metres for up to 30 minutesiPhone 11 Pro is available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB models in midnight green, space gray, silver and gold, starting at \u20b999,900.The 11 Pro, however, has the Telephoto lens with a focal length of a phenomenal 52 millimetres. This lens is ideal for subjects positioned further away. And finally, Night Mode on the 11 series is instinctive in terms of subject lighting, while retaining the integrity of a night-time shot. Video recording is a dream; the stabilisation better than ever, allowing for smoother filming. But Twitter and WhatsApp can mess up slow-motion and time-lapse footage. It doesn\u2019t stop there; if you\u2019re looking forward to the highly-anticipated Deep Fusion technology, expect it to be closer than ever to the clarity of fine detail of an SLR with a large lens.After some of the gut-wrenching price tags from Apple over the years, the 11 has a pretty decent price-point of under \u20b970,000. But don\u2019t think of this model as Apple\u2019s \u2018budget 11 series model\u2019; it still packs a punch. The Pro and the under-mentioned Pro Max are the burlier siblings, offering a more immersive experience for filmmakers and gamers if Arcade\u2019s caught their eye. But if we\u2019re getting into universal gaming on its own, the OnePlus 7 and the ASUS ROG Phone II have pushed the envelope here. Overall, the 11 series has been well formulated for the Indian market, who are across the range from curious to loyalists.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru. File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Amazon is endorsing the idea of government regulation of facial recognition technology, as part of a wide-ranging statement of its principles on a range of social and political issues.The US tech giant, which has come under scrutiny by antitrust enforcers and has been criticised over its use of facial recognition software, set out its positions in a statement posted late Thursday on its corporate website.Some of those stances, such as its endorsement of a raise in the federal minimum wage, were previously disclosed by Amazon.The statement also reiterated recent comments by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos on efforts to battle climate change.On facial recognition, Amazon said it believes that \u201cgovernments should act to regulate the use of this technology to ensure it's used appropriately.\u201dThe company noted that it offered its own set of guidelines for facial recognition that \u201cprotects individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their application of the technology.\u201dThursday's statement said governments \u201cshould work quickly to put in place a regulatory framework\u201d for the technology, which has been used increasingly around the world amid criticism on privacy and civil liberties concerns.Amazon also said it supports diversity and rights of persons of any gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion and sexual orientation and \u201cstrongly\u201d endorses immigrant rights and immigration reform.The company said it will back US federal privacy legislation \u201cthat requires transparency, access to personal information, ability to delete personal information, and that prohibits the sale of personal data without consent.\u201dThe federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour in the US \u201cis too low and should be raised,\u201d Amazon said, noting that it has promised to pay a minimum of $15 an hour and has encouraged others to follow suit.Amazon, which critics say has paid little or no income taxes in recent years, said it endorses a review of the international tax system.\u201cCorporate tax codes in any country should incentivize investment in the economy and job creation,\u201d the company said.\u201cIn addition, tax codes, particularly between countries, should be coordinated to have neither loopholes that permit artificially lower tax rates nor overlaps that cause higher tax rates or redundant taxation, because these distort company behavior in ways that don't benefit consumers or the economy.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nIndia\u2019s data localisation plans hang in the balance \n",

      " India\u2019s data localisation plans hang in the balance as it will join the other Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) countries on Thursday in discussing the e-commerce chapter of the RCEP agreement. The RCEP meeting will take place in Bangkok from October 10-13. If India agrees to the provisions of Chapter 10 on e-commerce, as specified by most of the other countries, it will mean it won\u2019t be allowed to impose data localisation rules on companies looking to do business in India.This would go against the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) norms on localisation of payments data that it had ordered in April 2018. \u201cNo Party shall require a covered person to use or locate computing facilities in that Party\u2019s territory as a condition for conducting business in that territory,\u201d reads the wording in the draft chapter \u2014 as suggested by Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2014 reviewed by The Hindu.Further, the suggested phrasing by the 14-member group (the RCEP comprises 16 countries including China) on cross-border electronic transfers is that \u201ca Party shall not prevent cross-border transfer of information by electronic means, where such activity is for the conduct of the business of covered person.\u201dIn its April 2018 notification, the RBI had said that \u201call system providers shall ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in a system only in India\u201d. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. tech giants plan to fight India\u2019s data localisation plans \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nU.S. tech giants plan to fight India\u2019s data localisation plans This data is to include the full end-to-end transaction details, information collected, carried, or processed as part of the message or payment instruction. If India agrees to the wording as it is, then these rules by the RBI will also have to be reviewed, as would any future plans the government has to implement data localisation in any form.However, Indian negotiators are trying to dilute the provisions in the Chapter, by including a provision to make the RCEP clauses subject to domestic laws. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. will consider \u2018301 probe\u2019 on India, says trade official \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nU.S. will consider \u2018301 probe\u2019 on India, says trade official India\u2019s suggestion for the Chapter thus reads: \u201cNo Party shall, subject to laws and regulations framed by it from time to time, require a covered person to use or locate computing facilities in that Party\u2019s territory as a condition for conducting business in that territory.\u201dA similar change has been suggested to the clause on the transfer of electronic information across borders, where India wants to make the clause subject to domestic laws and norms framed from time to time.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nPayPal said Friday it is withdrawing from the Libra Association so it can focus on its existing businesses.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Paul Sakuma  PayPal has pulled out of Facebook\u2019s digital currency project, known as Libra, a blow to the social media company that has faced stronger-than-expected scrutiny over its proposed creation of an alternative payments system. The digital payments company said Friday it is withdrawing from the Libra Association so it can focus on its existing businesses. \u201cFacebook has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal, and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities,\u201d PayPal said. Facebook has presented Libra as a currency that could be used for digital payments, particularly outside the U.S. It would be backed by real currency, unlike other digital currencies like Bitcoin or Etherium. The Libra Association, based in Switzerland, was supposed to give the currency project a comfortable arm\u2019s length distance from Facebook, which wouldn\u2019t own Libra. Despite Facebook\u2019s efforts, financial regulators as well as members of Congress have questioned the company\u2019s motives for creating a new digital currency, particularly in light of criticisms that Facebook\u2019s business model is too invasive of its users\u2019 privacy. Rep. Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, has demanded Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg testify in front of her committee before Libra is rolled out. Along with privacy concerns, Waters\u2019 has cited the potential for Libra to be used in money laundering and other financial crimes.Republicans and Democrats and even President Donald Trump have called for in various degrees for Facebook to be subject to U.S. banking laws an arduous, complicated prospect if the social media company does move forward with the Libra project. In response, Facebook has reportedly hired several prominent Washington lobbyists to convince politicians to give their approval to Libra.PayPal Holdings Inc., which is based in San Jose, California, is the first company to publicly end its partnership with Libra, but other companies have been reportedly having second thoughts. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Mastercard and Visa, the world\u2019s largest payment providers, were considering ending their Libra relationships. The Libra Association said it plans to continue to move forward with the project without PayPal. \u201cBuilding (Libra) is a journey, not a destination ... each organization that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises,\u201d said Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The motorcycle will be equipped with a connected cluster and a gold finish racing chain, it said in a statement. The Bluetooth-enabled TVS SmartXonnect technology of TVS Apache RTR 200 4V is paired with the TVS Connect App, which is available on Google Play Store and iOS App store, the company said. The application hosts multiple features including navigation, race telemetry, tour mode, lean angle mode, crash alert and call/SMS notification. While the lean angle mode uses the gyroscopic sensor on the phone to record the rider\u2019s lean angle through the corners while displaying it on the cluster, the race telemetry records and summarises essential data at the end of every race or ride. Crash alert system is triggered when the bike senses a fall. The system enters crash alert mode and within 180 seconds notifies the rider\u2019s emergency contacts with the location of the fall, the statement said. TVS Apache RTR 200 4V is powered by a 197.75cc single-cylinder motor which is mated to a 5-speed gearbox.

      "Facebook Inc said on Thursday it was launching a separate camera-first messaging app, \u201cThreads\u201d, for its photo-sharing platform Instagram, stepping up the company's social media war with smaller rival Snapchat.The launch of the app, which like Snapchat and Instagram is centered around photos but is more focused on keeping users connected with small groups of friends, knocked 5% off Snap Inc's shares in afternoon trading.Through Threads, users can upload status, share location and battery status with their close friends on Instagram, the social media company said in a blog post.Facebook has been focusing on Instagram, its fastest-growing revenue generator, as its core platform has been under scrutiny from regulators regarding privacy and spread of misinformation or fake news.Users can also enable \u201cauto status\u201d feature, which would automatically update their battery life and status based on current location, the company said, adding that the feature is an opt-in.Precise location information collected for auto status will be specific to Threads and will not be used for ads, Facebook said.\u201cThe way we use data from other parts of Facebook and Instagram to deliver relevant ads to you remains the same,\u201d the company said.Instagram launched \u201cClose Friends\u201d feature in November last year, allowing users to share their stories with a smaller group of people.

      "\n\nU.S. authorities press Facebook for access to WhatsApp, other encrypted messaging \n",
      "Updated: October 4, 2019 07:46 IST\rPublished: October 4, 2019 06:32 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-authorities-press-facebook-for-access-whatsapp-other-encrypted-messaging/article29592267.ece",
      " U.S. Attorney General William Barr and other U.S., U.K. and Australian officials are pressing Facebook to give authorities a way to read encrypted messages sent by ordinary users, re-igniting tensions between tech companies and law enforcement. Facebook WhatsApp already uses so-called end-to-end encryption, which locks up messages so that even Facebook can\u2019t read their contents. Facebook plans to extend that protection to Messenger and Instagram Direct. But the officials will ask Facebook to hold off in an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes,the officials wrote. The letter repeatedly emphasises the dangers of child sexual exploitation to justify their stance. Law enforcement has long sought a way to read encrypted messages that analogous to wiretaps for phone calls. Security experts, however, say giving police such access makes messaging insecure for everyone. Redesigning encryption to create backdoors for police also creates vulnerabilities that criminals or foreign spies can exploit, they say. Every couple of years, the FBI rears its ugly head and tells us they need to have access to end-to-end encrypted messaging, said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group. \u201cYou cannot make a backdoor that only good guys can go through,\u201d she added. Facebook said on Thursday that people have the right to have private conversations online and that companies are already able to respond to government agencies when they receive valid legal requests. \u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere,\u201d Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement. The letter marks yet another salvo in the Justice Department continuing effort to persuade technology companies to weaken or bypass encryption upon requests from law enforcement. Former FBI Director James Comey championed the need for law enforcement to find a workaround for encrypted devices and communications. He led a highly publicised push to gain access to an iPhone belonging to one perpetrator of a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people in 2015.Apple resisted such efforts and went to court to block an FBI demand for Apple to disable security measures that complicated efforts to guess the phone passcode. While the FBI cast its request as a limited emergency measure, CEO Tim Cook argued that the technique could easily be used again, making iPhone users more vulnerable to spies and thieves. The FBI relented after it found another way of getting into the San Bernardino phone. Barr will make the request to Facebook in a letter with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australia Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. BuzzFeed News reported on the letter earlier. The Justice Department calls the growing use of end-to-end encrypted communications the ongoing dark problem, referencing the way encryption shields information that law enforcement could previously access easily. Barr gave lengthy comments on what he described as a dangerous increase in device encryption at a cybersecurity conference this summer in New York. During his comments, Barr specifically detailed the use of WhatsApp group chat by a drug cartel to coordinate the murders of Mexico-based police officials. In announcing plans in March to expand encryption, Zuckerberg acknowledged that the privacy protection it affords extends to he privacy of people doing bad things. He said Facebook was working on better ways to detect patterns of bad behaviour, without seeing contents of messages.

      "Facebook on Wednesday was dealt a major blow in the EU\u2019s top court, which ruled that national courts in Europe can order online platforms to remove defamatory content worldwide.In a closely watched judgment, the European Court of Justice said EU law \u201cdoes not preclude\u201d courts from ordering \u201cthe removal of information or to block access worldwide,\u201d a statement said.The decision will be seen as a victory for EU regulators, who are ambitious to see US tech giants meet tightened European standards over hate speech and offencive content.Last week, the same court decided that Google was not legally compelled to apply the EU\u2019s strict \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules globally, in a victory for the search giant.The latest case was brought originally to an Austrian court by Greens party politician Eva Glawischnig, who requested the removal of Facebook posts that the judges found defamed her and could be seen by users of the social network around the world. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook begins hiding \u2018likes\u2019 in Australia\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFacebook begins hiding \u2018likes\u2019 in Australia\nA higher Austrian court referred the case to the EU\u2019s top court for an opinion and the judgment, which cannot be appealed, will now be used as a reference Europe-wide.In addition to the deletion of messages, the Greens had demanded Facebook provide information to determine the identity of people in fictitious accounts that often carried the most virulent comments.The original complaint concerns messages from one of these fictitious accounts, which according to the Greens, had called Eva Glawischnig a \u201ccorrupt\u201d person and which the social network refused to delete.With the decision, Facebook and similar platforms such as Twitter, face a greater obligation to monitor their content and take down content found to be offensive or hateful.EU-wide, so far online giants that also include Google\u2019s Youtube, have agreed to voluntarily takedown hateful or dangerous content, including those linked to terrorism, within 24 hours.However, the EU is expected to propose tougher Europe-wide measures that could include fines if Facebook and others fail to comply with orders.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nJasper, a prototype \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nBy arrangement  At SP Robotics Maker Lab in Nallagandla, Jasper greets visitors at entrance. Standing at 4.5 feet tall, she is a six-wheel 30 kilogram bluetooth controlled delivery robot that can carry upto 50 kilogram of items in her belly. \u201c Say hello to Jasper; meet my new friend,\u201d says a few boys and girls enthusiastically. That\u2019s when we realise Jasper is the prototype of an Amazon autonomous delivery robot that the children have built. \n\n\n\n\n\nA group of students with Jasper, a prototype\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nBy arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nDruthi Jallu, Paritosh Sai, Ananya Kappagantu, Anirudh Vijay, Dev Aditya Mohan, Mahidhar Damarla, Ram Tej Alla, Akhilesh Yalamarthy, Sruthi Jallu, Vishnu Chinta and Shyamala Durge Thanush took three months to create Jasper with the supervision of their two teachers Vishlavath Ganesh Kumar and Jana Anvesh. These young minds (aged 8 years and above) were guided by Abhinav Rao, who teaches and creates robotic projects on weekends. These weekly classes helped students share ideas and conceptualise the design. \u201cStudents should have robotics, theory and practical in their curriculum. You cannot live without them now so you have to be prepared,\u201d says Abhinav. At the centre, students are introduced to practical robotics with basics of electronics, mechanics and programming. Initially the students deliberated on project ideas. Once they decided on making a robot Jasper, it was a three month process that began by determining the height of the robot and its targeted function. The idea was not to make Jasper big as transporting it would have been tough. \u201cBattery is the energy source and the first thing to plan, followed by controls. It is a blue-tooth controlled module; we can control it like a joy stick,\u201d points out Abhinav. The sessions were fun and a burst of ideas as they shared their wacky ideas \u201cOne boy wanted to make a racing car and later one student wanted to put Jasper in the swimming pool to see if its body is harmed. With a limited budget, we couldn\u2019t experiment with their ideas,\u201d laughs Abhinav admitting it was difficult to channelise the enthusiasm of the teenagers. With mild steel for the body; six wheels sourced from market and an acrylic sheet used to keep it light weight, Jasper cost \u20b9 1,00,000 (borne by the centre). \u201cThe eye on it makes Jasper look like a human being and attractive to users,\u201d he points out. Jasper travels at a speed of 5 kilometre per hour and its storage box is 3 feet by 2 feet and 1.5 feet tall. The group also shows a small ranger robot on which they have tried, tested and learnt its applications. Jasper is now a permanent fixture at the centre, enthralling visitors (\u201cStudents can reassemble it again.\u201d). \u201cIn its one-and-half year journey, the Lab has produced a string of young innovators,\u201d say teachers. Among the student creations are a a food delivery robot (for use at tables in restaurants), a shoe for the blind which beeps when there is an obstacle, and a washing machine, a grass cutting machine, a floor cleaning robot and a low-cost driverless car. Two students, Niranjan and Jaidev Chinda even won a special prize at RoboRav in Japan.Rajni Rao the owner of Maker\u2019s Lab, a dentist-turned-entrepreneur plans to set up an in-house library on robotics and Artificial Intelligence.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nPhoto for representation.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Despite rising censorship of Twitter posts and accounts on the basis of legal demands from the Indian government, law enforcement agencies and others over the last five years, the lack of transparency behind suspensions, blocked tweets and the practice of shadow-banning has left users angry.Between June and December 2018 (the last period for which data is available), Indian government, law enforcement agencies and others made 657 legal demands for content removal, apart from 10 court orders. Overall 2,228 accounts were reported, of which 95 accounts and 114 tweets were withheld.Indian demands for content removal were the fourth highest in the world for this period, and have increased 100-fold from the same period five years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0When contacted by The Hindu regarding such cases of censorship and the process followed to ensure transparency, a Twitter spokesperson refused to answer specific questions, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons... At Twitter, no one is above our rules. We enforce our policies judiciously and impartially for all users \u2014 regardless of their political beliefs and background.\u201dInformation on official legal requests made to Twitter under Indian law is published twice a year, the spokesperson added.According to Twitter records, many content removal demands from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology simply cited a violation of Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. When Twitter receives such a demand, it usually sends an email notice to the affected user. (Twitter says it does not send such notifications if prohibited from doing so.)In August, Md. Asif Khan, a Mumbai-based professional with more than 20,000 followers, received such a notice from the Twitter Legal team, saying the company had received a request from an authorised entity in India claiming that one of his tweets violated the law(s) of the country, without specifying which law was violated, or which agency had made the complaint.The cited tweet promoted a documentary made by activists who had visited Kashmir after the abrogation of Section 370, using the hashtags #KashmirSolidarityDay and #KashmirUnderThreat. Twitter said it had not taken any action on the request \u201cat this time\u201d, but was informing him of the legal demand \u201cin the interest of transparency\u201d. If any action was taken, it would notify the third party Lumen database \u2014 again, if it was not prohibited from doing so.Twitter did not respond to a query on whether the Indian government ever prohibits it from making content removal demands public on Lumen.\u201cI have received several such legal notices and also been temporarily blocked and shadow-banned by Twitter itself, with no specific reasons given,\u201d said Mr. Khan. Shadow-banning occurs when Twitter limits the visibility of posts and users.In December 2018, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression David Kaye wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey expressing concern about the widespread removal of content related to Kashmir on the demand of the government, which affected Kashmiri journalists and activists among others.\u00a0Sharing the letter on Twitter, Mr. Kaye said, \u201cPlatforms may be improving but they are often opaque to users whose accounts are suspended or posts hidden from view, especially when under pressure from governments.\u201d It is this opacity that frustrated social activist and former civil servant Harsh Mander when the Twitter handle of his communal harmony organisation Karwan-e-Mohabbat was suspended for a day last week.\u201cWe did not receive any notice before the suspension. After we appealed and they restored the account; they sent us a bland statement, saying it was something about multiple hashtags,\u201d said Mr. Mander. The Twitter statement on the appeal gives no clear reason for the action, but warns that future behaviour violating its rules may result in permanent suspension.Ankur Singh, a Noida-based professional and right-wing commentator whose 53,000 followers including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claims Twitter censorship shows a \u201cliberal bias\u201d and participated in a right-wing youth protest outside Twitter\u2019s India headquarters during Mr. Dorsey\u2019s visit in February.\u201cTwitter blocked my account on January 23 without any valid reason, and said it was a permanent suspension,\u201d he said. After an online protest, Twitter restored his account the following day, saying it was wrongly included with spam accounts, but other right-wingers blocked at the same time are still suspended, he said, adding that he had been shadow-banned during the Lok Sabha elections.Unlike legal demands by government agencies, there is no record of content removed or shadow-banned by Twitter itself. Although Twitter users from both extremes of the political spectrum claim that they are being affected by the platform\u2019s censorship, right-wing users do not get content removal notices on government demand, agreed Mr. Singh. \u201cWhy will the government take action against their own supporters?\u201d he asked.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nIllusion-driven encounters of the tech kind at Hyderabad Design Week \n",

      "\nThe holographic framework of the Qutb Shahi Tombs, by Deepak John Mathew\n\u00a0 Design is a confluent term, and Hyderabad Design Week promises to capture how diverse this growing industry is, through their theme \u2018humanising design.\u2019 The event will be held in tandem with the 31st edition of the World Design Assembly in the city as well, serving as an extension for those local and from afar. A couple of years ago, IKEA made its foray into India which stimulated an all-rounding conversation around media arts and design but there were still some holes in the local conversation. So at Hyderabad Design Week, participatory art and multimedia amplifies this \u2014 don\u2019t look for mundane speaker sessions. Instead turn your heads to interactive installations such as ones by Loo Cafe and city-based studio DesignAware. French city-based artist B\u00e9atrice De Fays and French digital artist and musician Mathieu Constans have synced up to create VIA, an interactive installation fuelled by fine arts and the digital. \u201cLife is composed by actions and reactions of human beings leaving their traces on the environment, spatial as well as temporal, which successively leaves its mark on these beings. This is the creative chain being offered through this creation,\u201d B\u00e9atrice explains in her usual poetic style of explanation. \n\n\n\n\n\nB\u00e9atrice De Fays \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe artwork which is one aspect of the foundation here comprises layers. B\u00e9atrice has painted different iconic landmarks such as Errum Manzil, Qutb Shahi Tombs and Charminar but some areas are graphically (and intentionally) glitchy with overlays of computer coding and patches of deep-hued texture. When her partner Mathieu comes to Hyderabad, the design duo will be working for a few days on the development of the installation at Novotel Hitex, where she usually works. The core idea of the installation is for the participant \u2014 not viewer \u2014 to become more communicative with the self, the surroundings and others present in that space; it presents an interactive immersive environment generated in real-time by the visitors themselves.Another dimension of immersion is sound design is part of the experiential centrepiece of the VIA installation. Mathieu, who creates digital and interactive devices which give visitors the chance to experience and experiment with the artistic creation itself, works at the juncture of conscience and sensibility. He finds sound is an essential component of his experimentation which also include graphic creations. \n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the VIA interactive installation by B\u00e9atrice De Fays and Mathieu Constans\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe participants move through the process of transformation by immersing themselves in the space where the interactive installation is placed. The image, position and movements of the bodies of the participants are recorded in real time and in this way, their physical presence generates and activates a multimedia work that is constantly developing. Instead of seeing the quotidian and mundane surroundings we are used to, the elements of heritage and technology propel a time travel of sorts. Essentially, every participant has a different experience, says B\u00e9atrice and she adds that she hopes people will take something a bit more introspective away from the exhibit. The design community of the city is pretty familiar with the works of Deepak John Mathew, who has been dazzling many with his projects through his career as IIT Hyderabad\u2019s Department of Design\u2019s head. But Hyderabad Design Week will have a double-whammy from Deepak: a Virtual Reality experience of the Qutb Shahi Tombs and a Virtual Reality 360-degree animation which recants the journey of Hayat Bakshi Begum. \n\n\n\n\n\nA Virtual Reality 360-degree animation which recants the journey of Hayat Bakshi Begum, by Deepak John Mathew \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Virtual Reality experience is a literal walk through history, the planes around the seven tombs brought to life by emerging technology. Sound design plays an integral role in the walkthrough. \u201cThrough a unique interaction of heritage, design, and technology, the public will experience the lavish grandeur of the past amid the dynamic evolution of Hyderabad\u2019s present via a cutting-edge Virtual Reality experience that enables viewers to visualise the Qutb Shahi tombs in the glory days of the Nizams,\u201d says Deepak.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepak John Mathew\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe animation is surely an eye-catching one, especially for history and cinema buffs alike. \u201cExploring the latest technology of filmmaking, IIT Hyderabad presents the 360 degree Virtual Reality animation. Bringing together the latest in film technology with the rich narrative of Hyderabad's history, this installation will display the trailer of Ma Saheba- the Queen of Hyderabad,\u201d he explains."

      "\nThe hosts of GayBCD: Sunetro Lahiri and Farhad Karkaria\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n A new podcast is taking off. Now one-episode old, GayBCD co-hosted by Farhad Karkaria and Sunetro Lahiri, airs every Tuesday and hopes to be \u201cthe dictionary of all things in life from a queer perspective.\u201d Lahiri, 32 and Karkaria, 34 are creatives based in Mumbai. The latter also co-hosts another podcast on LGBTQ issues, called Keeping it Queer, with comedian Navin Noronha.The pilot episode, which premiered last week, is an hour-long freewheeling conversation between Karkaria and Lahiri, weaving in and out of their personal memories. Their lazy tone and banter might just end up working for what the duo is trying to achieve: to highlight everyday things concerning queer people as issues that aren\u2019t limited to being queer, but to merely \u201cbeing human\u201d. For example, their first episode, titled \u2018Coming Out\u2019, has Lahiri and Karkaria recalling how they told their respective sets of parents that they were not heterosexuals. Ahead of their second episode, which will be available to stream today, the duo spoke about the podcast, their approach, and what GayBCD hopes to achieve.Edited excerpts:Lahiri: Kavita [Rajwade, co-founder] of IVM Podcasts approached both of us separately. The idea was that the normalisation of queer life needs attention. This is how the conversation about the podcast evolved to us saying we will just talk about various aspects of life. This will be an unravelling of all things queer \u2014 so people can say that this is not a queer dictionary, it\u2019s a human dictionary.Lahiri: As the conversation takes an organic shape, these episodes also became like therapy sessions for us.There\u2019s so much unravelling happening, so many epiphanies. We also like being surprised by each others\u2019 responses.Karkaria: And a lot of times, it becomes therapeutic because we end up revisiting things that we don\u2019t think about any more.Karkaria: For instance, after the first episode, someone sent us a message about how he broke down after he heard the episode, and that led to a tender moment between him and his parents. He said that while he didn\u2019t come out to his parents, it was good for him to know that they were there for him. I don\u2019t have the aptitude to be an activist, but as long as it resonates with someone and gives some degree of comfort...[that\u2019s a start].Karkaria: We\u2019ve recorded a few already. Dating is one. For us, it\u2019s never been about just boys, boys, boy. Both Sunetro and I have had fulfilling, straight relationships in the past. "

      "\n26/09/2019, New Delhi: At the global technology brand OnePlus\u2019 launch of their flagship device, OnePlus 7T. The same event also saw the launch of their first smart TV\u2014 the OnePlus TV, a device that aims to seamlessly connect mobile and home networks for the future of interconnectivity\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nV V Krishnan  At the bright-red illuminated interiors of Indira Gandhi Arena (stadium) in Delhi, OnePlus made it amply clear at their September 26 keynote that they\u2019ve zeroed in on their target demographic and what they really want: entertainment and gaming.Zake Zhang, product manager of the smartphone brand, shared worldwide stats of 2,000 vlogs on YouTube every hour, and 400,000,000 watching online video every month. He said OnePlus has made its cameras incredibly stable and easy to use on-the-go. The team also announced that the 90Hz fluid display \u2014 which makes their phones \u201csilly fast\u201d as someone recently put it \u2014 returns to the OnePlus 7T, making the company\u2019s inclination towards gaming even more obvious and natural.When co-founder Carl Pei closed the keynote, he told the audience \u2014 who\u2019d paid a pretty penny to be there that night \u2014 that what they paid will be compensated on tickets to their Katy Perry and Dua Lipa concert in Mumbai this November. Loud cheers went up at all these junctures.For a lot of premium smartphone users, the OnePlus 7T\u2019s features might not have seemed as revolutionary as they were made to sound that night. Nor would the OnePlus TV and remote have impressed them. But making entertainment-friendly features available at just \u20b939,999, (the phone) and starting \u20b969,900 (the TV) spoke volumes of OnePlus\u2019 commitment to those in their late-teens till anyone in their early 40s.In an interview ahead of the launch, Vikas Agarwal, general manager of OnePlus India, spoke at length about doing a major launch in India, their sustained focus on this demographic, and the company\u2019s bigger plans with the launch of the OnePlus TV. Edited excerpts:While over 70% of our business comes from global regions, India has been our biggest success. And the launch is our big commitment to the Indian market. The OnePlus TV too is primarily designed and produced for the Indian market. We have timed to launch it before the festival season [in the country], so the latest product is in the market, instead of people having to buy from other inventory clearance sales. As for smartphones, today, OnePlus has a 43% share in the premium segment [devices of \u20b930,000+]. This is more than the combined share of the next two brands \u2014 Apple and Samsung \u2014 in India. And this has been just from online presence. But offline, have less than 10% share. [While] we already have 14 stores live, by the end of this year we\u2019re looking at 35 stores, and by the end of next year, 100 stores across top 50 cities. Creating an offline touchpoint has become more relevant because we have TV too, now. If it works here, we take it globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nFile photo of Vikas Agarwal, General Manager, OnePlus India\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: Bijoy Ghosh \n\n\n\n\nIndia has been our pilot market for a lot of initiatives in the past too: our global customer service operations are centred in India; we have our biggest global R&D centre \u2014 just launched in Hyderabad last month \u2014 and we\u2019ve further committed \u20b91,000 crores for developing this facility. So far, not many brands have focussed their R&D efforts in India. One Plus has also been manufacturing all its devices in India since 2015. This year, we are also looking at exporting from here.We\u2019ve always had challenges in managing our inventory. With every launch, our products have always sold out. We\u2019ve been conservative, and demand has outgrown the supply we were able to build. Today, we are relatively better, but still have lots to learn. As a company, we are not used to this growth. In the first year, we sold a million units globally. And now, we sell a million units in India itself. We have reached a very different scale. In the smartphone industry, most brands die because of inventory, not because of lack of inventory. That\u2019s something we are conscious of, and never want to take excessive risk that can question our survival.Shenzhen is really the hardware hub of China. It is a lot easier for me to experiment with fifty designs there than anywhere else, and get a prototype in the shortest possible time. That helps us optimise in iterations, adding value to our design capabilities.First, at OnePlus, we look at a device usability of three to four years. Even today, a lot of the devices we sold in 2015 are still active \u2014 perhaps passed on to others in the family, or resold. We keep track of all these active devices. Therefore, fundamentally, there is much less e-waste for our devices, compared to the industry. We also have our own network of 65 exclusive stores, which have a recycle programme. And now, our new buyback programme will help us reduce e-waste and create loyalty around us.Our TV\u2019s future is going to be as a \u2018smart hub\u2019. The way we see it is you will need a master device to manage all of your smart devices. The smart TV is possibly the best positioned device for this, because it has a display, it is right in the centre of your house, and you can interact with the TV in multiple ways. We are looking at the smart-home as the broader, key theme, and at the centre of that will be the smart TV.In the long term, there will be fewer dominant consumer behaviours, and brands will converge to [cater to] those. We are looking at a smart home OnePlus ecosystem of devices, but focussing on lifestyle and entertainment as key.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nThe Anime influence in Code Vein and Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-anime-influence-in-code-vein-and-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-remastered/article29557407.ece",
      "Code VeinDespite being in a niche, Dark Souls is an action adventure role-playing series that is a blockbuster in its own right, carving out a new sub-genre known as Souls-like, which is defined by brutal difficulty and nail-biting action. Code Vein is the latest game in that same vein (pun intended) with a different take on this realm.The first thing you\u2019ll notice about Code Vein is the heavy Anime influences, courtesy the gorgeous character creator \u2014 so intricate, you can recreate and portray your favourite hero. It may seem a bit odd if you have played a Souls game, but once you get past the contrast of the cartoonish against the realistic, Code Vein will not disappoint.Code VeinDeveloper: Bandai Namco StudiosPublisher: Bandai Namco EntertainmentPrice: Approx \u20b92800 for Nintendo SwitchThe world itself is fascinating, taking place in the aftermath of a mysterious devastation. Humanity is reduced to revenants \u2014 vampires that scour for both blood and sanity, pushing this rag-tag group further to find a way out of this cursed land where their bloodlust can drive them to become the Lost.A Souls game in movement Code Vein is more like Bloodborne in combat allowing you to use a variety of outrageously large weapons from three classes (Fighter, Caster and Ranger) with unlockable gifts to give you an edge. The best part? You can switch out your classes any time.The setting and monsters are dark and terrifying and the game does reward risk. To even things out, it introduces a meter that builds up as you successfully evade, letting you unleash a powerful attack; beware though, enemies have it too. In a radical departure from Souls-like games, Code Vein allows you to partner up with someone to go co-op.If you love the Souls genre, Code Vein offers you a slightly different take on it \u2014 with its refreshing Anime-inspired graphics and bold and bloody narrative, it is a solid game.Studio Ghibli has ignited our imaginations with some of the best Anime movies, like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. It was good news all around when they partnered up with legendary game studio Level-5 for a new Ghibli adventure, you can play through. Ni No Kuni was released on the PlayStation 3 and instantly became a bestseller in 2013, and now the game is back on this generation of consoles.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou play a boy named Oliver, who after the loss of his mother, is transported to another world by a fairy. Where it is revealed that both worlds are connected by soulmates and he has the chance to save his mother in his world, by hopefully saving her soulmate. Ni No Kuni, despite its cheery upbeat graphics, tells a surprisingly mature story, that hits the right notes as you journey through this mysterious realm.Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch RemasteredDeveloper: Level-5Publisher: Namco Bandai GamesPrice: Approx \u20b92800 for Nintendo SwitchVery much like Pok\u00e9mon, you roam through this secret realm and collect \u2018Familiars\u2019 as you go along. These little creatures aid you in battle as you control them as well as your companions on a battlefield you can freely roam. Again, don\u2019t let the graphics fool you, as the game can be surprisingly challenging to the point of frustrating, so it\u2019s best played in the easy mode setting.While the game sticks to its Japanese RPG roots, with a linear story and quests to indulge yourself, it does let you roam about freely, letting you take in the sights. Which is undoubtedly beautiful, especially on the PS4 or Xbox One. Though where the game shines is on the go on your Nintendo Switch, though that version is not the remastered, but the PS3 version, which holds up very well on the Switch display.Ni No Kuni is the perfect way to experience a classic, especially if you\u2019re a Ghibli fan and want a perfect JRPG to keep you busy on those commutes.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWing Commander Abhinandan, Rafale aircraft and more in IAF\u2019s video game, A Cut Above\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/wing-commander-abhinandan-rafale-aircraft-and-more-in-iafs-video-game-a-cut-above/article29557083.ece",
      "The feeling of sitting in an aircraft (even an aircraft simulator) is overwhelming in the best way; a glance over the numerous controls, your peripheral vision being open skies, and a feeling of power that signs, seals and delivers the whole experience. The closest second, though, is offered through the mobile game, Indian Air Force: A Cut Above. In the game, you fly the Hawk, Mi-17, C-17, Apache, Mirage 2000, Su-30 and the headline-making Rafale aircraft. Just like 2014\u2019s Guardians of the Skies from IAF, this game is built by Threye Interactive, a Delhi-based game development studio.\u201cWe invested in mobile games to reach the Indian youth through a platform preferred by them,\u201d says Group Captain Anupam Banerjee, IAF spokesperson. Both games have been downloaded over a million times on the Google Play Store. On the first day, A Cut Above was downloaded over 50,000 times. He adds, \u201cThe primary aim of this game is to get youth attracted to the profession of military aviation, while providing information about career options in the Indian Air Force.\u201dThe back endUnity 3D laid the foundation of the gaming engine; application logic to execute flight physics, flight-handling and enemy AI3D computer-aided design using Blender 3D, Autodesk Maya Indie Edition, GromeUser Interface (UI) and experience (UX) done on SketchAudio effects produced on Audacity and Mac text-to-speech generatorProject management by Trello and SourceTreeFive years ago, little did Anurag Rana, CEO of Threye, and his team know they would make video games for mobiles. Their first stint with animation was a short film titled Rockets Away (published on YouTube, May 2013). It tells the story of the IAF Mi-17 helicopters\u2019 attack on Tololing Hill during the Kargil War of 1999. Owing to its success, they decided to develop Operation Morning Glory, a five-level PC game. Taking fans\u2019 requests seriously, they listed it on the Google Play Store as well. As of now, the nine-megabyte game has over 1,00,000 downloads. So when they saw the IAF\u2019s open call for mobile game developers, Anurag and his team knew they were in for business.As per their blog \u2018How the Indian Air Force got its game\u2019 from June 2017, they faced competition from 120 developers, including Disney-UTV and Reliance. In December 2014, Guardians of the Skies was released by Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, at the IAF Auditorium, Subroto Park, New Delhi.After you launch A Cut Above, the first thing you will see is the silver IAF emblem, followed by a brief loading screen before the home screen loads. Here, you will see an anonymous officer with Abhinandan on the name-tag. There are three game modes to choose from \u2014 training, single-player and free flight. In the last one, for some reason, you have to register with your email address to play.Go for this if you want to try out the different IAF aircraft without completing the tutorial. Register, and you will see a persona of a pilot with a gun-slinger moustache. Thus, officially give a shout-out to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, recipient of the Vir Chakra gallantry award in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single-player has 10 distinct missions, such as a surgical strike, air-to-air refuelling and base defence. This mode is unlocked only after completing the training with all nine stars. You can\u2019t blame the Indian armed forces for being a stickler for perfection, can you?Indeed, there is a learning curve for the first-time player, but the clunky controls make that challenging. Nikhil Abhishek, a Visakhapatnam-based gamer, feels the controls are fine as along you have to just fly. This changes quickly when you have to shoot at specific targets or land on the runway. \u201cYou have to wait until you\u2019re close to the target to actually see it. Then you only have a second or two to take your shot. The poor controls are your enemy here, not the targets,\u201d he says jokingly.Games like PUBG have made high-end graphics on a mobile the norm. That said, aesthetically, A Cut Above doesn\u2019t turn heads. Anupam says \u201cFurther development will be decided after analysing response from the users.\u201d The success of video games like Age Of Empires, Civilization and Assassin\u2019s Creed has shown there is a market for the history genre. Considering the fact that the primary target audience of A Cut Above is teenagers and college students, it seems like a missed opportunity to mix education with fun. Perhaps the further developments Anupam referred to can include trivia about the IAF or a sneak peek into life in blue. The only source of information is the \u2018career navigator\u2019 button on the home screen of the game which links to IAF\u2019s recruitment website.Chandigarh-based Mukul Verma, who aspires to join the armed forces, says, \u201cI like the game but it is not designed in a way to create curiosity among people who aren\u2019t particularly keen to join the forces. I know about the game because I am interested in joining the forces.\u201d A multi-player mode of A Cut Above is expected to release this month.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "At MIT Technology Review\u2019s EmTech conference last month, deepfake expert Hao Li, whose team worked on putting the late Paul Walker (or rather, his digitally recreated self) in Furious 7, said, \u201cOur guess is that in two to three years, [deepfake] is going to be perfect. There will be no way to tell if it\u2019s real or not, so we have to take a different approach.\u201d In an interesting coincidence, a few days after Li\u2019s ominous proclamation, Google released an open-source dataset, containing 3,000 original manipulated videos, to aid researchers develop deepfake detection systems. The tech giant, in this pursuit, has collaborated with its incubator, Jigsaw.The technique used in Furious 7 is only similar and not the same as deepfake, which has been used to reach many malignant ends, like fake news proliferation and fake celebrity pornography. Scarlett Johansson, a victim of deepfake porn, told The Washington Post last year, \u201cClearly, this doesn\u2019t affect me as much because people assume it\u2019s not actually me in a porno, however demeaning it is. I think it\u2019s a useless pursuit, legally, mostly because the internet is a vast wormhole of darkness that eats itself.\u201dWith the US Presidential election less than a year away, fake news propagation, using deepfake, is a looming threat. Google\u2019s move, hence, is timely. \u201cWe firmly believe in supporting a thriving research community around mitigating potential harms from misuses of synthetic media, and [the] release of our deepfake dataset in the FaceForensics benchmark is an important step in that direction,\u201d wrote Nick Dufour of Google Research and Andrew Gully of Jigsaw in the Google AI Blog \u2018Contributing Data to Deepfake Detection Research\u2019 on September 24, 2019. To make the dataset, Google and Jigsaw worked with 28 actors, over the past year, to record hundreds of videos. \u201cUsing publicly available deepfake generation methods, we then created thousands of deepfakes from these videos,\u201d Nick and Andrew explained, \u201cThe resulting videos, real and fake, comprise our contribution, which we created to directly support deepfake detection efforts. As part of the FaceForensics benchmark, this dataset is now available, free to the research community, for use in developing synthetic video detection methods.\u201dLast January, Google released a dataset of synthetic speech, in support of the Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing And Countermeasures Challenge, to develop high-performance fake audio detectors.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSpaceX's Elon Musk gives an update on the company's Mars rocket Starship in Boca Chica, Texas U.S. on September 28, 2019.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled the latest iteration of his space company's newly assembled Starship, outlining a speedy development timeline for the centerpiece vehicle of SpaceXs quest to launch humans to the moon and Mars.Mr. Musk showed a crowd of space enthusiasts and reporters at SpaceX\u2019s rocket development site late on Saturday in the remote village of Boca Chica, Texas, animations of Starship landing on the moon and Mars and predicted that the rocket's first orbital flight could come in the next six months, followed by missions to space with humans aboard the next year.\u201cThis is basically the holy grail of space,\u201d Mr. Musk said, standing between a towering, newly assembled Starship rocket and Falcon 1 the company's first vehicle whose debut orbital mission was celebrated by SpaceX 11 years ago.\u201cThe critical breakthrough that\u2019s needed for us to become a space-faring civilization is to make space travel like air travel,\u201d said Mr. Musk, who is also the chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla Inc.Starship, a shiny steel rocketship designed to ferry dozens of humans to the moon and Mars, is the top half of Mr. Musk\u2019s colossal interplanetary rocket system that stands 387-feet tall (118 metres) as the latest addition to SpaceXs lineup of reusable launch vehicles. Mr. Musk named Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as Starships first private passenger in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nA prototype of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft is seen before SpaceX's Elon Musk gives an update on the company's Mars rocket Starship in Boca Chica, Texas U.S. on September 28, 2019.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nReuters\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The Boca Chica village, a few miles north of the Mexican border, is ground zero for SpaceX\u2019s three-year experimental test programme for Starship, whose rocket engine tests have rattled the nerves of residents living in a remote hamlet of roughly two dozen homes a mile away.\u201cI think the actual danger to the Boca Chica village is low but it's not tiny,\u201d Mr. Musk said during a question and answer session. \u201cSo probably over time it had be better to buy out the villages, and we have made an offer to that effect.\u201dSome residents have rejected SpaceX\u2019s non-negotiable offer to buyout their homes for three times the market value.A three-legged prototype of the rocket named Starhopper has test launched in the village twice since July, most recently flying as high as 500 feet (152 metres) and landing on an adjacent slab of concrete to trial Mr. Musk\u2019s next generation rocket engine dubbed Raptor.Mr. Musk\u2019s mission to the moon aligns with NASA\u2019s goal of sending humans there by 2024 under its Artemis programme, an accelerated deep-space initiative spurred by the Trump administration in March that aims to work with a handful of U.S. space companies in building a long-term presence on the lunar surface before eventually colonizing Mars.The space agency has tapped SpaceX to figure out how to land vehicles on the lunar surface and help develop a system for refueling rockets like Starship in space, an important technology to aid sustained exploration efforts on the Moon and Mars, NASA said in a release on Friday.NASA has awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co. a total of $6.8 billion to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil for the first time since 2011. Development of both astronaut capsules have been beset by delays and testing mishaps.\u201cI am looking forward to the SpaceX announcement tomorrow. In the meantime, Commercial Crew is years behind schedule,\u201d NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a September 27 night statement. \u201cNASA expects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer.

      "\nPhoto for representation.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: VIVEK BENDRE India has an estimated over 6 lakh rogue or unregulated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and security agencies are analysing modern anti-drone weapons like \u2018sky fence\u2019 and \u2018drone gun\u2019 to counter terror or similar sabotage bids by these aerial platforms, official sources said on Sunday. An official blueprint prepared by central agencies has been accessed by PTI that states unregulated drones, UAVs and remotely-piloted aircraft system are a \u201cpotential threat\u201d to vital installations, sensitive locations and specific events and a \u201ccompatible solution\u201d is required to counter them. A data estimation study conducted by these agencies states that over 6 lakh unregulated drones, of various sizes and capacities, are present in the country and anyone of them can be used for launching a nefarious act by disruptive elements. Recent incidents like the lethal drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest petroleum company and arms dropping by UAVs in Punjab from across the India-Pakistan border has alerted Indian security and intelligence agencies.These agencies are now looking at some specific anti-drone techniques like sky fence, drone gun, ATHENA, drone catcher and Skywall 100 to intercept and immobilise suspicious and lethal remote-controlled aerial platforms. A recent paper titled \u2018Drones: A new frontier for Police\u2019 published in the Indian Police Journal (IPJ) by IPS officer and Additional Director General in Rajasthan Police, Pankaj Kumar Singh, has talked about these new techniques.A drone gun is capable of jamming the radio, global positioning system (GPS) and mobile signal between the drone and the pilot and forces the drone to ground in good time before it could wreak any damage. This Australia designed weapon has an effective range of 2 kms, the paper said. Another solution to block a lethal drone is the sky fence system that uses a range of signal disruptors to jam the flight path and prevent them from entering their target, a sensitive installation or event venue, it said. Officials said prototypes of these counter-drone weapons were displayed for the first time at an open field in a BSF camp in Bhondsi, Haryana last week as part of a national conference organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) on anti-drone technology. A Bengaluru-based private company, BEML and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) among others showcased the latest technology available in this domain to the participants of the national conference which included officials from the Indian Air Force (IAF), airports guarding force CISF, Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India among others, they said. A drone gun and sky fence looks feasible solution and are being recommended to the government for consideration, a senior official in the security establishment said. ATHENA, acronym for Advanced Test High Energy Asset, is another weapon under analysis as it works by firing a high energy laser beam on a rogue drone resulting in its complete destruction in the air. However, this is a very costly technology and is being currently tested by the U.S. army, officials said. A counter-UAV technology called drone catcher\u2014 that swiftly approaches an enemy drone and grabs it by throwing a net around it\u2014 is also being considered.Such a tool is required when a rogue drone is needed to be captured safely to extract incriminating evidence from it, the paper presented by IPS officer P.K. Singh said. A \u2018skywall 100\u2019, the paper said, is the ground version of the \u2018drone catcher\u2019 and it works by bringing down an UAV using a parachute that is hurled through a net from 100 meters distance. Two separate BPRD and Ministry of Civil Aviation (MCA) appointed task forces are now mulling on \u201cpriority areas that need to be armed with counter-drone weapons and the cost estimation to procure suitable gadgets,\u201d the senior official said.

      "\n\nExplained: What is \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019? \n",
      "Updated: September 29, 2019 12:22 IST\rPublished: September 29, 2019 00:02 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-is-quantum-supremacy/article29543857.ece",
      "The story so far: Tech websites and theoretical computer-science outlets were aflame earlier this week after a story in the U.K.-based Financial Times said Google had claimed to have achieved \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019. In a line, it means that researchers at Google had solved a really difficult problem in seconds with the help of quantum computers which a supercomputer could not. The research paper is yet to be formally vetted by peers in the field and became public after having appeared briefly on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website \u2014 apparently some of its researchers were involved in the project. It is likely to reappear soon in a complete form.Quantum computers work differently from the classical computers we work on today. Exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, they can easily tackle computational problems that may be tough for the classical computer as the size of the numbers and number of inputs involved grows bigger. Quantum computers do not look like desktops or laptops that we associate the word \u2018computer\u2019 with. Instead (and there are only a handful of them) they resemble the air-conditioned server rooms of many offices or the stacks of central processing units from desktops of yore that are connected by ungainly tangled wires and heaped in freezing rooms. Conventional computers process information in \u2018bits\u2019 or 1s and 0s, following classical physics under which our computers can process a \u20181\u2019 or a \u20180\u2019 at a time. The world\u2019s most powerful super computer today can juggle 148,000 trillion operations in a second and requires about 9000 IBM CPUs connected in a particular combination to achieve this feat. Quantum computers compute in \u2018qubits\u2019 (or quantum bits). They exploit the properties of quantum mechanics, the science that governs how matter behaves on the atomic scale. In this scheme of things, processors can be a 1 and a 0 simultaneously, a state called quantum superposition. While this accelerates the speed of computation, a machine with less than a 100 qubits can solve problems with a lot of data that are even theoretically beyond the capabilities of the most powerful supercomputers. Because of quantum superposition, a quantum computer \u2014 if it works to plan \u2014 can mimic several classical computers working in parallel. The ideas governing quantum computers have been around since the 1990s but actual machines have been around since 2011, most notably built by Canadian company D-Wave Systems.The speed and capability of classical supercomputers are limited by energy requirements. Along with these they also need more physical space. Looking for really useful information by processing huge amounts of data quickly is a real-world problem and one that can be tackled faster by quantum computers. For example, if we have a database of a million social media profiles and had to look for a particular individual, a classical computer would have to scan each one of those profiles which would amount to a million steps. In 1996, Lov K. Grover from Bell Labs discovered that a quantum computer would be able to do the same task with one thousand steps instead of a million. That translates into reduced processors and reduced energy. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat quantum computing means for your bank accounts and smartphones\nIn theory, a quantum computer can solve this problem rapidly because it can attack complex problems that are beyond the scope of a classical computer. The basic advantage is speed as it is able to simulate several classical computers working in parallel. Several encryption systems used in banking and security applications are premised on computers being unable to handle mathematical problems that are computationally demanding beyond a limit. Quantum computers, in theory, can surpass those limits.Quantum supremacy refers to quantum computers being able to solve a problem that a classical computer cannot. In the research paper, Google used a 53-qubit processor to generate a sequence of millions of numbers. Though these numbers appeared randomly generated, they conform to an algorithm generated by Google. A classical supercomputer checked some of these values and they were correct. Google\u2019s quantum computer, named Sycamore, claimed \u2018supremacy\u2019 because it reportedly did the task in 200 seconds that would have apparently taken a supercomputer 10,000 years to complete.Impressive as this may sound, experts caution that this does not imply that the quantum computer can solve every challenging problem thrown at it. The number-generating task was the equivalent of having a Ferrari and a truck compete in a race and, on the car\u2019s predictable victory, declare that the Ferrari could do everything that a truck did. While IBM and a few other private establishments also have quantum computer prototypes, a common ailment is that they have their own unique propensity to errors and are not as amenable to executing real world problems as super computers.Then again, nothing yet rules out the creation of new mathematical methods or techniques that would allow classical computers to execute the same task faster. Some experts even question the term \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 coined by theoretical physicist John Preskill of the California Institute of Technology, United States. However, the Google feat shows that quantum computers are capable of a real world task. It gives confidence to private entrepreneurs and even academics to invest time and money to improving them and customise them to real world problems. In terms of the number of qubits, D-Wave Systems says it is ready to commercially launch a 5000-qubit system by 2020. It already has a 1000-qubit system at NASA. D-Wave claims that car maker Volkswagen used its quantum computers to figure out how best to control a fleet of taxis in Beijing relying on data from 10,000 cars, but the research paper describing this experiment does not quite explain how the proposed solution is better than algorithms that are currently used to optimise traffic flow.A question critics raise is how the use of quantum computing and its ability to break encryption codes will impact online banking. Breaking banking grade encryption is far away. Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist who has written on Google\u2019s feat, opines that current encryption standards would require a quantum computer to have \u201cseveral thousand logical qubits\u201d working in tandem perfectly. It requires millions of qubits of the kind that powers Sycamore to make \u2018logical qubits\u2019 and the 53 at Sycamore\u2019s disposal does not quite cut the ice. However, there are other approaches to designing quantum computers and with it there may be cleverer ways to solve problems using them. Moreover, if technological breakthroughs were to pose a real threat to banking or financial operations, it is likely that banks will harness quantum computers themselves."

      "\nVeronica Awungshi\n\u00a0 YouTube recently held a contest called the NextUp Women to Watch, where entries were invited from women creators across the country. The contest was aimed at spotlighting and supporting women on the channel. The creators had to meet certain requirements, like a certain subscriber count, to participate in the contest.Forming a part of the Women to Watch India Class of 2019, are 12 winners who will attend the five-day creator camp in Delhi, ongoing currently. Through various sessions, they\u2019ll learn content strategy, camera work, production design and other skills. YouTube will also host past winners of the contest to share their journeys. They will also win a voucher worth Rs. 1,40,000 to invest in production equipment, to help grow their channels. Here are a few women who made it. Born in Manipur and brought up in Meghalaya, Veronica Awungshi, now 23, shifted to Delhi in high school and later graduated from Sri Venkateswara College, Delhi University. She started making fashion videos in 2016, and sharing them through her YouTube channel.She later tried her hand at dance and lifestyle videos (shopping, travel, restaurant reviews), which have now become a major part of her channel. The initial response that she received from her community as well as her family wasn\u2019t positive. \u201cThey used to think that I\u2019m just a spoilt kid living in Delhi and wasting my parents\u2019 money,\u201d she says.It was after she won the title of Miss Spring 2018 at the Shirui Lily festival in North East India, and competed for the title of Miss Manipur 2018, that her community became more accepting of her. Awungshi\u2019s family, she says, \u201care still new to the idea of YouTube as a career and want me to study further.\u201d However, she enjoys the process of creating content and is determined to carve out a niche for herself as a creator.In 2016, Ramsha Sultan, now 24, started her own beauty channel on YouTube. An electronics communication engineer with a masters degree in business administration, Ramsha offers advice on skincare, make-up, and what she calls \u201cmodest fashion\u201d (styling a burkha, for instance). \n\n\n\n\n\nRamsha Sultan \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nShe started making videos in the final year of her engineering college, to satisfy her \u201ccreative thirst\u201d. \u201cIt was a real struggle to manage both,\u201d she says, but a year later, she started receiving numerous queries about places to buy \u201cthe perfect hijaab to be worn around the head\u201d from her viewers. Sensing a \u201ca gap in the market\u201d she also also began an online store with scarves and accessories manufactured in Delhi and Kashmir. Every year, she does a Ramzan talk series, where she \u201caims to bring an end toIslamophobia by clearing the misconceptions people have about the religion,\u201d through lifestyle content. She explains why women wear a burkha, why people fast, the reason for the Namaaz, amongst other topics. Two students of biotechnology, Prerna Srivastava and Parul Kaul, both 21, loved dancing from when they were together in school. In college, they decided to start their own dance channel on YouTube, called Unmasked. They currently have more than 57 dance videos across various dance styles such as BollyHop, jazz fusion and contemporary.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerna Srivastava and Parul Kaul, the duo behind Unmasked\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nWhile Prerna is a professionally trained Indian classical dancer (Kathak and Bharatnatyam), the Parul has trained in certain Western dance forms. However, it was when they posted their first few videos in 2017, that they realised that their \u201cdancing quality was not up to the mark.\u201d They also got some negative feedback about their fitness, which they had to work on.Currently, they go to college through the week, choreographing and shooting videos over the weekend. \u201cWe have promised each other to continue with YouTube full time, if our subscriber count reaches 100,000 by the time we finish college,\u201d they say. Prerna and Parul aim to form their own dance crew and start a dance academy in the future.Shalini Mandal, 24, started her channel in 2016. Beginning with beauty related content, she currently covers lifestyle, fashion, skincare and self-care regimens.\n\n\n\n\n\nShalini Mandal\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nAn electronics and communication engineer, Mandal got to know about YouTube in her second year of college and was fascinated by the process of creating informative and realistic content for people. However, she took up a marketing job after college, which she later quit to become a full time creator. \u201cI was a total introvert and used to think that I was only meant for a 9-5 job,\u201d she says.It was also her salary from that job which helped her in finance the production of her first few videos. Mandal, who believes in hard work and consistency, has now collaborated with over 10 brands, while yearning to motivate people through her content. Inspired by creators like Bethany Mota and Shreya Jain, she aims to have her own production company and a clothing line in the future.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nShubham Jain\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSPECIAL ARRANGEMENT  WorldSkills is an organisation that has built a movement, and is changing the lives of young people by promoting different skills. Every two years, it organises world championships of vocational skills, which is held in different parts of the world. It brings together youngsters, industries, governments, and educational institutions, to promote the benefits of and need for skilled trade professionals.This year, the competition was held in Kazan, Russia, wherein more than 1,500 competitors from 60 countries competed in 55 skill competitions at this mega event. This year, India participated in 44 skills including mobile robotics, prototype modelling, hairdressing, baking, confectionery and patisserie, car painting and floristry, among others. Start of the journeyAmong the 48 participants who represented India, Shubham Singh bagged the \u2018Medal of Excellence in Cyber Security\u2019. Shubham is pursuing his final year of Bachelor\u2019s of Computer Applications (BCA) from Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab. He first got to know about the India Skills competition (the first level of WordSkills) through a friend. The first phase of the competition was held in September 2018, which was an online test of different challenges consisting of topics such as web testing, forensics, malware analysis, reverse engineering and so on.After scoring third place in this round, he headed to Delhi for the finals in which he was awarded first place. Shubham was then invited by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) India to participate in the WorldSkills International Competition, where he took part in cyber security skills competition along with Swapnil, his teammate from Delhi.To prepare for the competition, he had to first polish his skills in areas such as cryptography and encryption, which he was able to do with the help of his professor, Gurupreet Kaur, who guided him whenever he faced any challenges, especially in cryptography. Afterwards, Shubham and Swapnil both trained with Infosys for a month which enhanced their skillsets. In August 2019, they both went to Kazan, Russia, along with the other participants. The main part of the WordSkills competition was held over four days in which the participants were given specific tasks and challenges. They were evaluated and scored by experts in the field on their ability to \u2018attack\u2019 the opposing system, as well as defend their own system from being \u2018attacked\u2019.\u201cInitially, I did not know that the competition would be this big,\u201d says Shubham. \u201cHowever, this competition helped me in more ways than I expected and I was able to learn a lot from it.\u201d He goes on to say how his professors were a big support during the entire process of the competition, from helping in clearing doubts to helping him catch up in the classes he had to miss during the training period.Future funding Talking more about his experience at Kazan, Shubham adds, \u201cI interacted with many participants from various skill backgrounds, as well as from those in my own skills set from other countries. There was a lot for me to take away from this opportunity and this experience will help me in the future.\u201d Shubham will be felicitated by the Government of India and National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), later this month.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Facebook on Friday said that it began hiding the number of \u201clikes\u201d for posts in Australia, a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide. Account holders across the country were also blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people\u2019s posts from Friday, but were still be able to see how people respond to their own. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Facebook to feel like a competition,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis is a test to see how people engage with this new format.\u201d \u201cWe hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly.\u201d More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide, but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform\u2019s impact on mental health. In Australia, one in five children report experiencing cyberbullying, according to the country\u2019s e-Safety Commissioner. The problem received national attention last year when a 14-year-old girl killed herself after being bullied online. Facebook\u2019s decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide \u201clikes\u201d on the company\u2019s other major social media platform, Instagram.  The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for. \u201cWe want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions,\u201d said Mia Garlick, of Facebook Australia.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nFirst impressions of Apple iPhone 11 Pro: so far, so great\n\n",
      "Updated: September 27, 2019 16:21 IST\rPublished: September 27, 2019 16:21 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/apple-iphone-11-pro-first-impressions-review-2019-so-far-so-great/article29530702.ece",
      "If you were tuning into the Apple Special Event livestream in September, every iPhone feature announced by Tim Cook and his team was met with wow\u2019s and claps, but today, we tell you if those moments of awe were worth it. The hype around iOS 13 (which rolled out worldwide on September 19) was largely around Dark Mode, the keyboard\u2019s Quickpath, the adorable Memoji feature and, for the geekier folks out there, the ARKit 3. But the true potential of iOS 13 is best harnessed by the iPhone 11 series, a clever if not cunning move by tech giant Apple. iPhone 11 Pro specsDisplay: 2436x1125-pixel resolution at 458 ppi , 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio (typical)Splash, water and dust resistant: rated IP68 (maximum depth of 4 metres up to 30 mins) under IEC standard 60529Battery: Lasts up to 4 hours longer than iPhone XS | Video playback: up to 18 hours | Video playback (streamed): Up to 11 hours | Audio playback: Up to 65 hoursAt 188 grams the iPhone 11 Pro is slightly lighter than the iPhone XR\u2019s 194 grams, with the newer model looking much sleeker and compact than the XR. Right off the bat, the speed of iPhone 11 Pro is mesmerically fluid, the new A13 Bionic chipset making its mark. As this is a first impression, the official later review will determine how truly effective it is. A13\u2019s Third Generation Neural is a major result of Apple\u2019s machine learning developments; it understands your usage patters quickly and helps you ultimately save battery power, answering the long-pervasive problem of Apple\u2019s less-than-lacklustre battery power. For some clarity, the day started with a 94% battery and (given my Screen Time feature showed a 7-hour and 43-minute usage), I was pleasantly surprised at the 57% battery by 10:30pm.After a 45-minute gaming session of Capcom\u2019s Shinsekai Into The Depths on Apple Arcade, the battery power didn\u2019t take too much of a hit. The memorable audio experience promised at September\u2019s event came through; Apple\u2019s spatial audio, propelled by Dolby Atmos, is immersive but only to an extent \u2014 it\u2019s not as though you\u2019ll magically have overheard sound range. The 5.8-inch Super Retina XDR Display on the iPhone 11 Pro is a stunner; if you switch devices, you\u2019ll notice the difference right away. Earlier models had a maximum of 625 nits of maximum brightness while the 11 Pro dazzles at 800 nits maximum brightness for the typical display and 1200 nits maximum brightness for HDR experiences. A better display means a better camera experience. The iPhone 11 series has upgraded for sure, pegging the much-memed cameras on the back as a unified triple-camera system with all-new Ultra Wide, Wide and Telephoto cameras. Essentially, they function intuitively and harmoniously with the phone, rather than just as an additional accessory. \n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of the triple-camera system design; it\u2019s a little jarring and takes some getting used to \u2014 plus, it really takes away from Apple\u2019s usual fluid design IQ. Night Mode on the 11 series is impressively intelligent in terms of subject lighting while retaining the integrity of a night-time shot. As you get more familiar with aperture calibration, this should be more fun over time. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor travellers or photographers, the Ultra Wide lens is a treat as it offers \u0192/2.4 aperture plus a 120-degree field of view \u2014 perfect for stretching landscapes in a range of lighting. After all, not every pretty landscape can be captured as it is through a panorama. Ultimately, the iPhone 11 Pro offers a so far, so great experience, but more long-term judgements around real-time processing, battery life and videography will come soon. iPhone 11 Pro is available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB models in midnight green, space gray, silver and gold starting at \u20b999,900.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Updated: September 27, 2019 18:55 IST\rPublished: September 27, 2019 15:51 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/tales-from-twinkle-khannas-new-website-tweak/article29530122.ece",
      "\nTwinkle Khanna\n\u00a0 Twinkle Khanna is flustered. One of her children is competing for her attention as she fields questions about her latest venture. In a moment reminiscent of the many droll anecdotes that light up her d\u00e9but book, Mrs Funnybones, the child is triumphant and drags her away. Khanna excuses herself apologetically: \u201cIt is Saturday. Everyone is home.\u201dWe\u2019re discussing Tweak, the women-centric digital media platform launching on September 30. It promises to be \u201ca space for the modern Indian woman to challenge old ideas and discover new ones and offer readers solutions that offer maximum results with minimum effort\u201d. Khanna says that the idea found its roots in the many women who approached her after her columns became popular. \u201cI realised that even though these women often had starkly different backgrounds, they had similar problems.\u201dThe easiest way out, she admits, would have been to start an Oprah-style TV show. However, that would have clashed with her penchant for avoiding the spotlight. \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to continually fix my eyelashes and make-up. I\u2019d rather go to work in my pyjamas.\u201d Her work apparel of choice led to a rather more ambitious denouement. Tweak will have contributions from experts in various fields, eminent writers and celebrities. These range from parenting (with an emphasis on topics like bullying, LGBTQ+ sensitisation, gender equality) to wellness (with a holistic approach to fitness, positive body image and mental health awareness). \n\n\n\n\n\nTwinkle Khanna with Sudha Murthy\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the platform is not yet live, the publicity material suggests Tweak will also provide a deep-dive into culture, with a focus on sustainability, beauty, career and lifestyle. \u201cWe wanted to make the aspirational a little more acceptable,\u2019\u2019 says Khanna. \u201cNot that it means we\u2019ll push a $4,000 Dolce & Gabanna bag, nor will we nudge you towards Big Bazaar. We\u2019ll help you find a trendy sweet spot.\u201d Doesn\u2019t this sound uncannily like the Refinery29 of India? Khanna says the team looked at the most popular platforms in India and abroad (which includes the aforementioned Refinery29, apart from Goop and POPxo) and found that there was an opportunity to learn from the best and turn it into something unique. What\u2019s special about the platform, according to her, is that it is agnostic to demographics. \u201cWe\u2019re not running after just the youth. We also want to hear from older folks. Nobody seems to want to hear from them, but their experience matters. They have so much more to share.\u201d  In times when the explosion of content is almost anxiety-inducing, and platforms are constantly competing for eyeballs, Khanna says the quality and range of content are key to set themselves apart. \u201cWe have something for everyone: short and long reads, podcasts, videos and events. And we aren\u2019t giving sermons or telling people how to live. We\u2019ve kept our tone irreverent and funny. I think that\u2019s why people read me, and I hope that works for the platform as well,\u201d she says. The team running Tweak is small but feisty. While the initial plan was put together by Khanna and Vikram Raizada, they eventually recruited Rochelle Pinto, a former digital editor at Elle and GQ, to be editor. \u201cWe planned to have very skilled writers as freelancers supported by our in-house writers doing simpler pieces. Ultimately, it turned out to be the exact opposite. Our in-house team of 11 is brilliant,\u201d says Khanna. Have they figured out how to make money off a content platform? Khanna says it would be foolish to enter a business without a plan. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified five revenue sources \u2014 but I can\u2019t tell you what they are. We don\u2019t want others to benefit from our hard work! Hopefully our projections will hold up.\u201d She also emphasises that technology plays a critical role in ensuring the success of such platforms as well, right from the back-end that manages content, to the servers that handle it. As for the overall approach, Khanna says it is three-pronged: in-house opinion, contributions from freelancers, and articles by experts in various fields. She herself will contribute long-form pieces and conduct interviews with experts and celebrities. \u201cTrust me, interviewing is much more challenging than being the interviewee,\u201d she laughs.Given the celebrities who have recently taken to social media to promote Tweak, I ask if there\u2019s another writer from the fraternity who is ready to surprise us with their pen. \u201cA lot of people started writing at the same time as I did. I don\u2019t know how they fared and whether they were passionate enough about writing,\u201d she says. For her, however, the last seven years have been transformative. Writing is now an inseparable part of her. \u201cI don\u2019t know a different way of living. I didn\u2019t have any acting skills, so thank God I could write!\u201d There is a thoughtful pause. \u201c... But I don\u2019t want Tweak to be about me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative platform. I\u2019d like it to stay that way.\u201dJust as we\u2019re winding up, another (or perhaps the same) recalcitrant child clamours for her attention once again. She returns to our conversation with a well-aimed dig: \u201cThis is what women have to deal with, even when we\u2019re doing interviews. Somehow, this doesn\u2019t really happen to men.\u201dVisit tweakindia.com from September 30You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Now, with conversations about unplugging from social media and staying offline, the millennial and Gen Z folk are wondering the same. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely normal,\u201d Rega Jha assures us on a new YouTube show, Nerding Out. The short-format show is produced by Vitamin Stree, a women-centric content platform.Jha, former editor-in-chief at Buzzfeed India, has hosted and written the first episode on the attention economy. \u201cThe Internet has been an endless source of learning for me and I am so thankful to creators who make complex ideas accessible for the rest of us. This was my attempt at doing the same, breaking down something I think about a lot, which should be of urgent importance to all young people,\u201d she says. The second episode is set to release on October 2.The idea behind the show is simple, says Padmini Vaidyanathan, editor and creative head of Vitamin Stree. \u201cWe wanted to talk about experiences and behaviours that are an integral part of life, but are also changing the way we are. Some of it is existential \u2014 like how can I not be addicted to social media, when everything is happening there. Others are more cultural, like the beliefs we have grown up with which are not necessarily true,\u201d she says. Apart from Jha, who will host a few more episodes on non-sexual consent, modern love and romance, other influencers will come on board shortly. At a time when there is a shift towards authenticity and engagement over just numbers on social media, how did they pick the influencers? \u201cThe answer is in your question,\u201d says Vaidyanathan, adding, \u201cWe approached those who are authentic and genuinely believe and know what they are talking about. For instance, Rega has consistently been vocal about being on social media and how addictive it can be.\u201dEach video is eight to 10 minutes long. \u201cWe wanted to deep dive into each topic and break it down for our viewers in detail,\u201d says Vaidyanathan. As the video continues to garner views (54,361 at the time of writing), they are planning offline events, with one slated for the end of this year or early next year. \u201cVitamin Stree exists because of a very strong, involved and loyal community and we want to engage with them as much as possible,\u201d she concludes.Watch Nerding Out w/ Rega Jha on the Vitamin Stree YouTube channel You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-a-doodle/article29527065.ece",
      "Today's Google Doodle celebrates the search engine's 21st birthday.On this day in 1998, Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, two Ph.D. students from Stanford, came up with the idea of launching a prototype of a \u201clarge-scale search engine\". \"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol [10 to the power of 100, or 1 followed by 100 zeroes] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines,\u201d they wrote in their paper.Their mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\". Google, operating today in over 100 languages, is considered one of the Big Four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple and Facebook. Now, the verb \"google\" has been added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"Google Doodles, too, have been part of the company since its inception. The very first Doodle was in honour of the Burning Man Festival of 1998. It was designed by Page and Brin themselves to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent ones were designed by an outside contractor, until the founders asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From then on, Doodles have been organised and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".As of October 2016, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries. Alexa, a commercial web traffic monitoring company, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube and Blogger.Google has often come under fire over issues of aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.However, it continues to answer trillions of search queries each year.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nIndia can become world leader in artificial intelligence: Vishal Sikka \n",
      "Updated: September 27, 2019 05:55 IST\rPublished: September 27, 2019 05:55 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-can-become-world-leader-in-artificial-intelligence-vishal-sikka/article29526434.ece",
      "\nVishal Sikka\n\u00a0 Former Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, who has announced a new AI startup with USD50 million fund, believes India has the potential to become a world leader in artificial intelligence but the key to this is integrating AI into the country\u2019s education system in a massive way.India is at \u201can inflection point\u201d when it comes to AI or artificial intelligence, Mr. Sikka said.Over the next 20-25 years, AI is going to be \u201ca very, very big disruptor\u201d for the Indian society because what one is seeing now in terms of automation and job losses is just the beginning, said Mr. Sikka, who announced his startup Vianai Systems last week.\u201cBut on the other hand, if we are able to bring AI education, the ability to build AI systems to India at a very large scale, and I\u2019m talking about like billion plus people, then India can really leap frog and become the world\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, in AI skill and AI talent,\u201d Mr. Sikka told PTI in an exclusive interview.Doing that requires working on multiple dimensions in parallel, he said.Last month, at the request of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Sikka gave a presentation before the NITI Aayog how to expand the reach of AI to the Indian society in a very big way.Representatives of some 20 Union Ministries were present during his presentation on AI and India. This, he said, required creating necessary infrastructure to bring the talent through institutions, schools and educational institutions, the ability to do AI education at a large scale.According to Mr. Sikka, the Prime Minister said he personally saw whenever classes worked into digital classrooms, he was joking that children would sometimes even forget to eat their lunch because they were so engrossed in learning. \u201cIt was very encouraging. But I think a lot of that has to be done,\u201d he said and suggested multi-faceted countrywide programme like digital classrooms.If India does nothing then this great wave of AI is going to have massive disruption over the next 20 years. But on the other hand, if it puts together programmes then this can be a huge advantage for it and \u201cwe can be a leader in the world,\u201d he said.Referring to his interactions with the Indian government officials and the steps being taken by Mr. Modi, Mr. Sikka said he is very encouraged by the commitment.His Vianai Systems is an AI Enterprise Platform startup with a mission to help businesses around the world successfully leverage AI to drive fundamental digital transformations.He said there have been remarkable achievements in the field of AI, but conceded that significant issues too have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence.\u201cThe technique themselves are quite opaque, not transparent. The lack of ability to explain is one of the major weaknesses of these techniques,\u201d Mr. Sikka said.He said that there is an incredible shortage of talent in the field of AI.With this in backdrop, Mr. Sikka said he started this venture to build a platform that can dramatically improve the accessibility of AI, that is educational, that explains to people how this works, that they can experiment with it, they can play with it, they can explore and understand what is happening.\u201cThat is what my prototype was about,\u201d said Mr. Sikka as he went back to his PhD thesis on AI in 90s.For its mass application in a transparent manner, he said there is a need to build a platform that is a dramatic improvement on what is available today.Mr. Sikka has raised USD50 million as the startup seed money.\u201cHopefully, we wouldn\u2019t have to raise any money again,\u201d he said, adding that the objective is to bring AI to businesses on massive scale. Last week, he demonstrated the first glimpse of the platform at the Oracle Open World event in the Silicon Valley.One of the reasons that there are so few applications of engineer machine learning is because the techniques and the tools are extremely dense, they are complicated, the experience of developer is broken profound.\u201cSo we wanted to make it dramatically simpler to access an AI system and to execute on AI. His platform dramatically simplifies the AI system from thousands of lines of codes to a few dozens of lines of codes. This will make the systems much much simpler,\u201d he said.\u201cWe have been thinking very carefully, and very diligently about how we can come up with a platform that is completely agnostic, completely open and yet makes it dramatically simpler, and more efficient and more exploratory to build an AI system. And with that when you think about a future where enterprises will deploy dozens, if not hundreds of AI applications, you need something like this to make that happen. And that\u2019s what we are working on,\u201d Mr. Sikka said.Last week, he announced a panel of advisors from industry and academia for Vianai. They include Henning Kagermann, former chairman and CEO of SAP and chairman of Acatech; Alan Kay, Turing Award winner and computer science pioneer; Divesh Makan, founder of ICONIQ Capital; Indra Nooyi, member of the board at Amazon and Schlumberger and former CEO of PepsiCo; and Sebastian Thrun, CEO of Kitty Hawk Corporation and co-founder and chairman of Udacity.\u201cEvery company that hopes to be a leader in their industry needs to understand the transformative potential of AI, and to successfully activate it within their organisations,\u201d said Nooyi in a statement.\u201cThe market need is immense, and Vianai, with its capable leadership and differentiated platform, is in a unique position to address it. I look forward to being an advisor to the company in the exciting times ahead,\u201d she said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nOnePlus 7T, OnePlus TV announced with starting prices of \u20b937,999 and \u20b969,900 respectively\n\n",

      "\nPete Lau, Founder and CEO of OnePlus with the new and highly anticipated OnePlus 7T.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nV. V. Krishnan  China-based mobile phone maker OnePlus launched its latest offerings, the One Plus 7T phone and the One Plus TV, in India on September 26.One Plus 7T: 8GB/128GB: \u20b937,999; 8GB/256GB: \u20b939,999The OnePlus 7T has three cameras, much like its predecessor, but they\u2019re arranged horizontally this time, inside a circular notch \u2014 perhaps replicating the more natural experience of how we use our eyes. In an interview, the General Manager of OnePlus India Vikas Agarwal had earlier said that this new setting was a \u201cbold move\u201d aesthetically.The three cameras are a 48MP primary, an 117-degree ultra wide camera and a 2x telephoto camera.Noticing the sort of macro shots being populated under the #shotononeplus, One Plus decided to have macro motors that\u2019d allow users to shoot from just 2.5 cm away from a subject.There is now an independent motor drive for just the haptics, too, for a better gaming experience.As for India centric features, OnePlus has announced a live cricket score widget on the minus one screens or shelves, improvements to their photo gallery to sort photos based on subject into smart albums (recognising faces, or actions and themes). All of this, they say, happens within the device itself and without internet connectivity \u2014 thereby ensuring privacy and efficient processing.To hoots and cheers, the company also announced a 5GB cloud storage should the user wish to upload photos, and an extra 50GB free storage for the first year for OnePlus 7T users.While a lot of these features might sound familiar for other premium smartphone users, what was really neat was their Work-Life Balance mode. Now, apps that you typically use for work will be in the \u2018Work\u2019 mode of the phone, while apps you use for friends, family, and non-work-related engagements, will be in the \u2018Life\u2019 mode. While on one mode, notifications from apps native to the other mode, will be in a kind of DND.They\u2019ve even added intelligence to this, with the OnePlus 7T picking up a change in location, or wifi connection, to automatically switch between these modes for you.The SMS sorting into spam and a \u2018focussed\u2019 folder of sorts (like on an Outlook email box or the more recent iOS rollouts) will prove to be a nifty feature, especially for the Indian context, where receiving advertorial spam is common.OnePlus TV: Q1 55-inch \u2014 \u20b969,900; Q1 Pro 55-inch \u2014 \u20b999,900 (available only in India)The TV will have a 55inch screen, and will use QLED technology. It has 4K resolution, and uses the Gamma Color Magic processor. But what really stands out as a differentiator for the OnePlus TV is retractable, sliding sound bar. There are 6 speakers facing the front of the TV, and 2 facing the back. Together, they will produce a 50W sound output (in comparison to a 20-40W sound output for any other high end TV in the market).The sliding motion of the sound bar comes with longevity for close to 100,000 motions \u2014 and this sliding itself will be quieter than the quietest of air conditioners, says OnePlus, at 32 decibels only.The OnePlus TV\u2019s carbon-fiber reinforced back panel comes with a magnetic plate into which all ports are neatly hidden. At its thinnest, the TV is 7 mm, and has a 95.7 percent screen-to-body ratio. However, design-wise, the remote doesn\u2019t seem entirely new \u2014 no numbers, minimal buttons.Use the TV to play music from your phone or and stream games as you\u2019re playing them, via bluetooth. The OnePlus TV comes with the Android TV 9, and is compatible with Alexa. The controlling via smartphone that they did a live demo of during the launch, seemed very similar to the operationality of the Amazon Firestick (trackpad on your phone to navigate the TV screen, type on your phone keyboard, instead of searching for letters on the TV screen).You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nGeet: A spoken-English teacher on TikTok\n\n",
      "Updated: September 26, 2019 14:56 IST\rPublished: September 26, 2019 14:13 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/society/meet-geet-a-spoken-english-teacher-on-tiktok/article29517973.ece",
      "Once a practising lawyer in the United States, Sangeeta Jain \u2014 \u201colder than an average TikTok user\u201d \u2014 is now a star, popularly known as Geet, on the platform. She has two channels on the video platform: on the first, @TheOfficalGeet, she puts up motivational, self-care, and self-help videos; on the second, @EnglishWithGeet, she shares snippet-sized spoken English lessons. \u201cHindi se English seekhne ke liye mere saath TikTok par judd jayiye,\u201d is her consistent sign off. Geet, who grew up in Seattle, wanted to be an actor. A childhood accident though, paralysed her waist-down. Her dependence on a wheelchair had kept her from breaking into the film industry. After being back-and-forth between India and the U.S., to work with children and at-risk youth here, in 2014 Geet participated on a Zee TV reality show, India\u2019s Best Cinestars ki Khoj. She couldn\u2019t make it past the dance rounds.\u201cWith that, the acting keeda had come back again,\u201d she says. In August 2015, with her brother\u2019s encouragement, she started her own Facebook Page. But not knowing what would work, she started with motivational videos. She took this to TikTok in February last year, while also putting up comedy shorts that she made with her 87-year-old grandmother. \u201cBut to my surprise, it was the motivational videos that did better; we had videos on socially relevant topics like domestic violence, saas bahu relationships, and confidence. I was getting thousands and views and comments even within the first few weeks,\u201d recalls Geet.Over time, noticing that her Hindi was weaker than her English, which she still speaks with an American accent, her audience started writing in with special request to clarify something. And so it began. She started with simple vocabulary (\u201cgorgeous\u201d instead of saying \u201cvery pretty\u201d) or correcting common mistakes (saying \u201cladies\u201d even for singular usage, instead of \u201clady\u201d). Her mother and grandmother starred in the video, acting like two people in conversation who didn\u2019t know the right usage. Today, Geet (she has about 4.5M followers on TikTok, 51.4k subscribers on YouTube and 5.4M followers on Facebook) also makes videos where she teaches English by translating a couple lines from popular Hindi songs. On Facebook and YouTube, she does a three-minute long series, which she makes and stars in, with other actors.Given her legal training in the United States, Geet says she believes in the freedom of speech.

      "\n\nNorth Korea-born YouTubers offer peek into lives in homeland \n",
      "Updated: September 26, 2019 10:35 IST\rPublished: September 26, 2019 10:34 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-born-youtubers-offer-peek-into-lives-in-homeland/article29516686.ece",
      "\nIn this photo, a smartphone screen shows North Korean refugee Jang Myung-jin as he films himself in a demonstration of his YouTube broadcast during an interview at his house in Seoul, South Korea.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Wearing a fedora, Jang Myung-jin shouts \u201cHello, comrades!\u201d as he starts his YouTube broadcast, titled \u201cA North Korean man, Tango.\u201d Then, he talks about whether North Koreans raise pet dogs, what type of profanity they use and whether there are any transgender people in the country. The 32-year-old Jang is among a handful of young North Korean refugees in South Korea who have launched YouTube channels that offer a rare glimpse into the everyday lives of people in North Korea, one of the world\u2019s most secretive and repressive countries. While mainstream outside media reports on North Korea focus on heavy subjects like the North\u2019s nuclear program or its internal power hierarchy, these young YouTubers feed a growing demand for softer news related to daily life in their former home country. Their rise comes amid increased public attention to North Korea, whose young leader, Kim Jong Un, has made global headlines with a provocative run of weapons tests and high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump. \u201cThere are people who yearn for real scenes showing how people in North Korea live. There is a niche market for that,\u201d said Jeon Young-sun, a research professor at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University. \u201cSimply speaking, some people are curious about what beer North Koreans drink and what cookies they eat.\u201d Jang uses his Samsung smartphone to film himself at his small Seoul apartment, and sometimes invites fellow North Korean refugees as guests and has friends shoot him when he ventures out. He often appears with his trademark dark fedora, but sometimes with a colourful wig, a false mustache or even a Kim Jong Un mask. Video clips uploaded on Jang\u2019s 2-year-old channel showed him saying that ordinary North Koreans usually raise dogs, rabbits, pigs and chickens, but to either eat or sell to markets. He said that calling someone \u201ca baby born by a young female slave\u201d is considered a profanity in North Korea, and that people there say \u201cDo you want to have the order of your ribs revolutionarily reorganised?\u201d when trying to intimidate others. Jang, who has about 7,000 subscribers to his channel, said he does manual labour and delivers fried chicken as a means of living because his YouTube-related income is too small. But he feels it\u2019s worth it to keep his YouTube career going because some subscribers have left messages saying his broadcasts helped resolve their misunderstandings of North Korea. \u201cThey cheer me up and make me be positive. They are the reasons why I shoot YouTube videos today and tomorrow,\u201d Jang said, petting his Maltese. Other North Korea-born YouTubers talk about why they left their homeland and the experiences they\u2019ve had in South Korea. Some also broadcast themselves putting on North Korean-style makeup or eating foods from the country. The young YouTubers are mostly stylish, contrary to the stereotype of North Korean refugees as being rough and unsophisticated. About 32,000 North Koreans have fled to the South over the past two decades to avoid poverty and political repression. Kang Na-ra, a North Korean escapee who regularly appears on two YouTube channels and two TV programs, is called \u201cPrincess Na-ra\u201d by her fans. The 22-year-old with long, brown-dyed hair said she has a 200-member fan club that has sent her a cake topped with a mini-Kang doll on her birthday for the past three years. When Kang, dressed in a North Korean military uniform, showed how to put on North Korean-style makeup on her YouTube channel, her subscribers wrote, \u201cYou are so pretty even without makeup\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re such a beauty.\u201d \u201cI like communicating with people by posting responses to the messages that they put on my channel,\u201d said Kang, wearing two rings on each of her hands. \u201cI want to let the people know about North Korean culture and show more about how I am living in South Korea.\u201d The YouTubers, however, also have anti-fans who often vent their anger at them when North Korea does something provocative like conduct a weapons test. Kang said she feels a \u201clittle sad\u201d when she reads malicious messages from people such as \u201cGo back to your country\u201d and \u201cWhy does a Red live here?\u201d Jang said some messages have been left for him wishing for him to be assassinated with a poisoned needle or banished to a North Korean coal mine. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this photo, North Korean refugee Jang Myung-jin edits his YouTube footage during an interview at his house in Seoul, South Korea. \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nAP\n \n\n\n\n\nWhile there have been some TV programs in the South featuring North Korean refugees, some experts say they don\u2019t fully carry the escapees\u2019 voices because they were directed, filmed and edited by South Koreans. \u201cOn YouTube, defectors can speak whatever they want without being filtered and edited. ... Given that, I would say their programs provide content that the TV shows can\u2019t provide,\u201d said Lee Kwang Baek, the South Korean head of a YouTube channel on North Korea. Their YouTube programs are also believed to help address the widespread misinformation about North Korea in the South. Jang said a middle school student once asked him if North Koreans eat dirt when they\u2019re hungry, while another escapee-turned-YouTuber, Lee Pyung, said he was asked whether North Koreans give potatoes instead of money to a driver when they take a bus. The YouTubers\u2019 most popular content is stories of their dangerous escapes to South Korea. Kang\u2019s escape story, posted on someone else\u2019s YouTube channel last year, has received about 1.7 million views. She said she thought she was going to die when she was carried away by water while crossing the Tumen River to go to China before coming to South Korea in December 2014. Kang said she ran away from her home in North Korea after fighting with her stepmother. Then her biological mother, who had already resettled in South Korea, hired brokers who helped her come to the South about two weeks later. Besides her longing for her mother, Kang said her wishes to wear jeans, dye her hair and date handsome South Korean men also pushed her to make a perilous journey to the South. Jang hasn\u2019t posted his escape story yet because he said he wants to fill his channel with more amusing content. Jang said he had a big crush on the 11-year-old girl with fair skin and big eyes, who lived with her grandmother. He recalled how the two would hold hands when he walked her to her house. After the girl didn\u2019t come to school for two to three weeks, their teacher asked Jang to go and check on her. When he arrived at her home, he found the girl, then all skin and bones, lying dead with her eyes and mouth open, while her grandmother had disappeared. Terrified, Jang immediately bolted out of the house and reported the girl\u2019s death to neighbors before crying all day. A few months later, he fled North Korea with his parents and younger brother. Before his family walked across the frozen Tumen River, his father told him to turn back and look at the country they wouldn\u2019t likely return to. \u201cWhile looking at my hometown for about five minutes, I thought about that girl,\u201d Jang said. \u201cI thought that her only fault was being born in the wrong country,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf she had come to South Korea, she wouldn\u2019t have starved to death ... and could have become a YouTuber like me.\u201d You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nAmazon Senior Vice President David Limp announces \u2018Echo Buds\u2019 headphones, with the company\u2019s virtual assistant Alexa built in, at a product launch at the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle, Washington, U.S.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n Amazon unveiled a lineup of new Alexa-powered products on Wednesday extending from homes and cars to wearable devices, and a celebrity voice option for the popular digital assistant.Alexa has been tweaked using machine learning to speak more like a person, and will offer celebrity voices \u2014 with the first being star actor Samuel L. Jackson.In a product launch in Seattle, Washington, Alexa was the star as Amazon sought to widen the reach of its digital assistant powered by artificial intelligence amid a battle with rivals from Google, Apple, Microsoft and others.Amazon began rolling out bilingual capabilities for Alexa, enabling it to perform in Spanish as well as English in the US; French along with English in Canada, and Hindi along with English in India, according to vice president of devices and services Dave Limp.The celebrity voice option from Amazon follows a similar move by Google, which gave users the option of hearing celebrity singer John Legend on the Google Assistant last year.Along with beefing up the Echo and Ring lines, Amazon introduced earbuds it touted as providing the first wearable, hands-free Alexa experience on the go.The $130 wearable devices will work with Google or Apple smart assistant software already on smartphones, according to Limp.The Amazon voice assistant was also infused prototype eyeglass frames on display at the media event along with an enhanced array of Echo smart speakers.\u201cAmazon just took a giant leap ahead of Google in the home,\u201d Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said.\u201cIt's not just the Amazon products, it is the more than 80,000 'Made for Alexa' products offered by partners.\u201dAmazon has unveiled eight new Echo devices for the U.S. market, three of which will be available in India for now.  For the India market, Amazon has introduced three new echo devices, which include the new Echo that features an updated fabric design and premium sound for \u20b99,999, the same price at which previous generation Echo is being sold. Echo Dot with clock, which has bright LED display that shows the time, outdoor temperature, timers, or alarms, will be available for \u20b95,499. The third product Echo Studio, priced at \u20b922,999, is equipped with five directional speakers for immersive studio-quality sound, room adaptation technology, and a built-in smart home hub. These three devices are available for pre-order in India on Amazon.in and select retail stores. Amazon launched five other echo devices for the U.S. market. These include Echo Flex and Echo Show 8 for greater access to Alexa at home. All-new Echo Buds, Echo Frames and Echo Loop will enable customers to use Alexa while on-the-go.The company also pledged to make user privacy a priority, responding to fears about how voice data is collected and used by technology companies.\u201cPrivacy is foundational to everything we do around Alexa,\u201d Limp said as he unveiled devices launching for the year-end holiday shopping season.Later this year, Amazon will add a \u201cHome Mode\u201d feature to its Ring smart cameras that will stop the devices from recording any video or audio until directed otherwise.Amazon added the ability to ask the voice-commanded digital assistant why it did something, or to reveal what it has heard. Alexa also got a feature that has it automatically delete voice recordings at specific intervals.\u201cIf you invite an always-listening, cloud-driven artificial intelligence into your life, you are going to encounter some privacy issues,\u201d said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart\u201cIt's Amazon's responsibility to mitigate them as much as they can; it was good to see some of the initiatives they rolled out.\u201dBecause people so often ask for the time, Amazon introduced a version of its Echo Dot smart-speaker with an illuminated clock.Alexa was also enhanced with the ability to tell when people are frustrated with her and try to make nice with the those issuing misunderstood commands.A new Echo Studio with sophisticated, rich sound quality was added to the lineup for $200, along with new Ring home cameras and small Alexa devices that are plugged into outlets to extent the digital assistant's realm.Amazon also announced a \u201cCertified for Humans\u201d program that identifies devices that people without tech skills can set up and use without hassle.Limp provided a glimpse at \u201cAmazon Sidewalk\u201d technology the company is working on to extend WiFi or Bluetooth signals beyond the walls of homes to reach gadget in yards or even pets gone astray.\u201cAmazon's sheer volume and variety of smart home products puts them in most of the major smart home zones \u2014 comfort, security, entertainment, and kitchen,\u201d said Forrester analyst Frank Gillett. \u201cThat means Amazon alone is contending for a wider footprint in the smart home than any other player.\u201d(With inputs from PTI)You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSocial media platforms are under pressure to be more transparent about policies on political content, after U.S. authorities alleged an extensive cyber-influence campaign by Russia aimed at helping Donald Trump in 2016./ File\n\u00a0  Facebook on Tuesday said it would not take down politicians' posts that violate its community standards and will not label them as rival Twitter has promised, saying it should not be the arbiter of acceptable speech in the political arena.Social media platforms are under pressure to block election interference and be more transparent about policies on political content, after what U.S. authorities called an extensive cyber-influence campaign by Russia aimed at helping elect President Donald Trump in 2016. Moscow has denied the claims.Facebook will take down posts if a politician's content has the potential to incite violence or pose a safety risk that outweighs the public interest value. And political advertisements must still meet Facebook's rules.The kinds of posts from politicians that could be kept up might include cruel or insensitive comments or graphic content.Facebook's head of global affairs Nick Clegg announced the stance in a speech in Washington D.C. on the social media giant's preparations for the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.\u201cWould it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company in effect become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say?\u201d Mr. Clegg asked. \u201cI dont believe it would be.\u201dThe comments follow Twitter's announcement in June that it would identify and de-emphasize tweets that broke its rules but were posted by important sources, such as politicians and government officials.If flagged, a notice would cover the offending tweet and require a user to click on a link to view it.A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that newsworthy content from politicians on Facebook would not be labeled to show it had violated the rules.Mr. Clegg, who was previously Britain's Deputy Prime Minister, also said Facebook did not submit original content from politicians to its independent fact-checkers. It will only demote and label previously debunked content that is shared by politicians.Facebook's third-party fact-checking program, which is used to label and de-emphasize false content, has been a centerpiece of its fight against disinformation.A Facebook spokeswoman said the global policy would apply to politicians at the executive, national and regional levels, including candidates for office.Facebook's stance on politicians' content builds on its policy, in place since 2016, to leave up content whose public interest it considers to outweigh the risk of harm.

      "\nInside the Loewenbraeu brewery's festive tent at Oktoberfest in Munich\n\u00a0 A few years back, South East Asia was the destination of choice for most first-time travellers from India. This was followed by mainland Europe \u2014 Rome, Venice and Paris. After the growing interest in Scandinavian countries and South America, travel plans are now centred around events, says Akash Dahiya, CEO and co-founder of SanKash. The Gurgaon based travel fin-tech platform offers EMI-based payments for holidays, in partnership with over 260 travel platforms. Since 2018, experiential music tourism within the country, to Ziro, Hornbill, Sunburn and NH7 Weekender, has been on the uptick, and now, millennials have set their sights abroad. The UN World Tourism Organisation estimates that around 50 million Indians will travel internationally this year, more than double the number in 2017. Couple this information with the fact that there has been a 55% growth in personal loans taken for travel \u2014 of which 85% are by millennials (according to a report published earlier this year by digital lending platform, IndiaLends). A 2018 study by Klook, a global travel activities and services booking platform, showed that 52% of Indians surveyed said they planned their vacations around seasonal activities and events. Abhinandan Sangam, co-founder and CTO of Finzy, a peer-to-peer lending platform that offers personal loans from \u20b950,000 to \u20b95 lakh, says that around 15% of their patrons (aged 24 to 39) use the money for travel. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that the Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan, La Tomatina in Spain and the Carnaval in South American countries have a lot of takers,\u201d he adds. Finzy, too, has partnered with around 20 travel agencies offering experiential holidays. Both Dahiya and Sangam agree that Bollywood has helped direct attention towards these event-based trips. India\u2019s obsession with Oktoberfest is well known: this weekend, several hotels begin a month-long promotion of beers from across the world, with menus featuring Bavarian specials. International travellers, however, want to get the real deal. Such is the demand, that agencies like SOTC and Thomas Cook, and even smaller ones across the country, have special tour packages for the event. \u201cThey take a couple of days in their Euro trip to halt at Munich and take in the festivities,\u201d says Dahiya. And presumably, all the brands of beer that they couldn\u2019t try back home.Visit sankash.in and finzy.comYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nSandesh and soul food on JustMyRoots\n\n",
      "Updated: September 24, 2019 15:08 IST\rPublished: September 24, 2019 15:08 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/sandesh-and-soul-food-on-justmyroots/article29498838.ece",
      "In the battle of the biryanis, Arsalan\u2019s potato-laden version has its staunch supporters. And sandesh isn\u2019t the same unless it is from Balaram Mullick. The argument over who invented rosogolla can be solved over a couple of the sugar-soaked chhena dumplings \u2014 we can conclude that it simply doesn\u2019t matter. With Durga Puja around the corner, Bengalis around the country don\u2019t have to travel all the way to Kolkata to sample these signature dishes. JustMyRoots (JMR), a food-tech platform, offers to bridge the gap by shipping speciality dishes from iconic restaurants to 21 cities across the country. CEO and founder Samiran Sengupta says the idea is to tap into the nostalgia that India\u2019s largely migrant population have for the food of their hometown. Apart from the sweets, savouries and cooked dishes, their offerings include fresh fish like hilsa and produce like gondhoraj lebu. The platform has also partnered with restaurants in Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai and Lucknow, with plans to expand to Chennai, Hyderabad and Kochi, among other cities, by the end of the year.The concept is simple: visit the website or app and order like you would on a food-delivery platform like Swiggy or Zomato. The only difference is that you have to wait a few days before it reaches you. However, Sengupta reiterates that the food reaches their customer within 24 hours of being prepared. Another option that JMR offers is Direct From Home. \u201cThis is a big hit with parents whose children stay in different cities. They can ship a home-cooked meal to their child for special occasions, or simply because they are missing home,\u201d he explains. The food is picked up and packed much like it is from their restaurant partners, and delivered within the same time period. Their other USP is the packaging, he says. Although other sites like PlaceOfOrigin.in ship sweets, snacks, dry fruits, namkeen, pickles, jams, tea and coffee, the fact that JMR deals with freshly-cooked dishes, put the focus on the supply chain. \u201cWe spent nine months to a year just perfecting the packaging based on both customer and partner restaurant feedback. We finally settled on a product from Israel, which maintains the temperature of the food between five and eight degree Celsius, which is ideal for transportation,\u2019\u2019 he says. Customers will have to heat the food before consuming, as it will be maintained at this optimal temperature while it is being shipped. Future plans include expanding to China and other South East Asian countries by the end of this year, or early 2020, to cater to the Indian Diaspora population. It is also close enough to fulfill their 24 hour promise.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-changes-privacy-settings-for-users-voice-recordings/article29497481.ece",
      " Facing the flak for letting contractors record and listen users\u2019 conversations via Google Assistant, the tech giant has announced to make some key changes in the way it records and reviews voice recordings.Google Assistant users will now need to confirm if they want to be part of the Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) process, which stores and reviews conversations.\u201cTo store your audio data, you can opt in to the Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) setting when you set up your Assistant,\u201d Google said in a statement late Monday.\u201cOpting in to VAA helps the Assistant better recognise your voice over time, and also helps improve the Assistant for everyone by allowing us to use small samples of audio to understand more languages and accents,\u201d the company added.You can view your past interactions with the Assistant, and delete any of these interactions at any time.\u201cIf you\u2019re an existing Assistant user, you\u2019ll have the option to review your VAA setting and confirm your preference before any human review process resumes,\u201d said Google.Google is updating its settings to highlight that when users turn on VAA, human reviewers may listen to your audio snippets to help improve speech technology.\u201cWe won\u2019t include your audio in the human review process unless you\u2019ve re-confirmed your VAA setting as on,\u201d the tech giant mentioned.Google last month stopped listening and transcribing Google Assistant recordings in Europe after Germany\u2019s data protection commissioner said the country was investigating reports that third-party contractors listened to users\u2019 bedroom talks captured by Google\u2019s AI-powered Assistant.Belgian broadcaster VRT NWS had reported that users\u2019 conversations with Google Home speakers were being recorded and audio clips were being sent to sub-contractors who then \u201ctranscribed the audio files for subsequent use in improving Google\u2019s speech recognition technology\u201d, raising serious privacy concerns.According to Google, audio snippets are never associated with any user accounts and language experts only listen to a small set of queries (around 0.2% of all user audio snippets), only from users with VAA turned on.\u201cFor those of you who have opted in to VAA, we will soon automatically delete the vast majority of audio data associated with your account that\u2019s older than a few months. This new policy will be coming to VAA later this year,\u201d it noted.VRT NWS, with the help of a whistleblower, was able to listen to more than 1,000 excerpts recorded via Google Assistant.The transcribers heard just everything: personal information, bedroom talks and domestic violence via Google Assistant in Belgium and the Netherlands.VRT \u201coverheard countless men searching for porn, arguments between spouses, and even one case in which a woman seemed to be in an emergency situation\u201d.Google said there will be additional security protection and additional privacy filters for Google Assistant in the near future.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " Facebook on Monday said it had made a deal to buy a startup working on ways to command computers or other devices using thought instead of taps, swipes, or keystrokes.CTRL-labs will become part of Facebook Reality Labs with an aim at perfecting the technology and getting it into consumer products, according to Andrew Bosworth, vice president of augmented and virtual reality at the California-based social network.\u201cWe know there are more natural, intuitive ways to interact with devices and technology,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said in a post at Facebook announcing the acquisition.\u201cAnd we want to build them. The vision for this work is a wristband that lets people control their devices as a natural extension of movement.\u201dMr. Bosworth explained that the wristband will decode electrical impulses such as those sent to hand muscles telling them to move certain ways, such as clicking a computer mouse or pressing a button.The wristband will translate impulses into signals a device can comprehend, having thoughts rather than mouse clicks or button presses prompt actions on computers, according to Facebook.\u201cIt captures your intention so you can share a photo with a friend using an imperceptible movement or just by, well, intending to,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.\u201cTechnology like this has the potential to open up new creative possibilities and reimagine 19th century inventions in a 21st century world.\u201dHe spoke of how thought-commanded interactions might dramatically alter how people experience augmented or virtual reality scenarios, which currently feature hand-held controls.Facebook did not disclose financial terms of the deal to buy New York-based CTRL-labs, but unconfirmed media reports said it paid more than $500 million.After Facebook bought virtual-reality gear startup Oculus in early 2014 in a deal valued at $2 billion, social network co-founder and chief Mark Zuckerberg heralded the technology as the next major computing platform.Oculus has since built a line of virtual reality gear, pushing down the price and eliminating the need to be plugged in to a computer with its Quest VR headset.In Early 2017, Facebook announced projects aimed at allowing users to use their minds to type messages or their skin to hear words.The projects were the focus of a team of scientists, engineers, and system integrators with a goal of \u201ccreating a system capable of typing 100 words-per-minute straight from your brain,\u201d Facebook said at the time.Such brain-computer interface technology currently involves implanting electrodes, but Facebook wanted to use sensors that could be worn to eliminate the need to surgically intrude on the brain.Such technology could for example let people fire off text messages or emails by thinking, instead of needing to interrupt what they are doing to use smartphone touchscreens.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nIs your data safe with intelligent apps?\n\n",
      "Updated: September 24, 2019 13:14 IST\rPublished: September 23, 2019 17:56 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/is-your-data-safe-with-intelligent-apps/article29490933.ece",
      "Whether you\u2019ve upgraded to iOS 13 or Android 10, there have been many surprises for mobile users, all of which have promised \u2018ease of living\u2019. The past few years of said surprises include improvements within voice assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, or something as seemingly basic as your built-in News apps. These encompassing programmes, however, are \u2018intelligent apps\u2019. While the name is fairly self-explanatory, let us get technical in terms of their modus operandi. I-apps, as they are commonly called, harness data based on user behaviour and other sources to make hypotheses and suggestions, ultimately delivering personalised and adaptive user experiences! Such apps are capable of converging database and data warehouse workloads, operating with Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. The home and quotidian life aren\u2019t the only scopes for such apps; the workplace is too. Especially companies which develop these apps. In a Medium blog post dated June 20, 2019, by Data Driven Investor, \u201cToday\u2019s digital natives demand much more than [simple mobile-enabled access to key business applications and data], they anticipate intelligent user experience and highly usable as offered by consumer apps. And, intelligent apps assure to provide the same.\u201dSo, what do we trust?Here are some warning signs for a concerning i-app. As a user, you can control how these apps operate and use your data\u2026 or you can choose to banish them from your smartphone and invest in a \u2018brick phone\u2019If they want you to only sign in through either Facebook or Google. These should never be the only options for using an app.These apps will have a large number of ads, often of the targeted variety. They\u2019ll try to capitalise on your retail inclinations and timings of mobile use.They may ask for permissions to many bizarrely irrelevant components on your phone. For example, why should a social media app want access to call logs?I-apps have been staring at you the whole time. In fact, we wouldn\u2019t say there are apps that haven\u2019t been made into i-apps at some point in their development timelines. For example, health trackers.Microsoft has Bing Predicts which understands users\u2019 patterns of web usage and even greater web trends and behaviours to get you answers fast, for the many types of questions you have. Bing then claims to verify concrete answers across multiple sources rather than just one. But what about more nuanced questions? Bing provides a carousel of answers gathered from the web, as well as info from the Reddit community.Then there are i-apps used to precipitate inclusivity. Closer to home, Envision AI is used by the visually impaired to recognise their surroundings, but the Artificial Intelligence components take the notions of assistive technology to higher levels by having the app continually learn and make sense of hand-writing and Indian scripts.Then there is the worry; the lip-gnawing and discomfort-inducing kind which has you considering throwing your phone into the nearest water body. We faced panic across fem-tech users, as Privacy International reported on September 9 how menstruation apps, which collect information about your health, your sexual life, your mood and more, could be sharing deeply personal data with Facebook. \u201cWe, therefore, wanted to make sure that they keep this information to themselves, rather than sharing it with other companies\u2026 We did a dynamic analysis of the apps using our data interception environment to look at the data that those apps share with Facebook\u2026 As we will expose in this report, Maya by Plackal Tech (over 5 million downloads on Google Play) and MIA by Mobapp Development Limited conducted \u2014 at the time of the research \u2014 what we believe to be extensive sharing of sensitive personal data with third parties, including Facebook.\u201dThis access is claimed to be due to Facebook\u2019s SDK for Android feature, which allows app developers to bind their apps with Facebook\u2019s platform. The feature contains a number of core components, such as analytics, graph API, login and even ads! Given medical data is considered to be the most personally confidential information we can have, many users were horrified by the terrifying side of i-apps.Then there was the huge craze of FaceApp, which thousands of people used to comically age themselves digitally. Many technologists were concerned with the amount of metadata harvested from users\u2019 phones in a similar way to Maya and MIA.So, think twice about the pedestalled placement of i-apps. Yes, they have the power to fuel the future and there\u2019s an unavoidable thrill with using many of them, but watch enough episodes of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, and you have got to wonder if you are just a statistic for the next generation of users.Byte-sized play-by-plays of tech conceptsYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nReview: Borderlands 3 offers a \u2018Call of slooty\u2019 gaming experience\n\n",

      "Avalanche Studios\u2019 first-person-shooter game, Rage 2 (released in May), with its maniacal bluster, deflated our expectations faster than a balloon pricked at a child\u2019s birthday party. 2K Games\u2019 Borderlands 3, hence, was expected to give us a much-needed fix of carnage and loot. Squarely falling under a sub-category of gaming called shlooters, the Borderlands series has prided itself over its abundance of loot, especially with Borderlands 2 providing, as it tagline claimed, a \u2018Bazillion\u2019 guns. After a disappointing Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 3 comes to us with more guns.The MacGuffin in the Borderlands series has always been a mythical vault on the planet Pandora, which is rumoured to have alien technology. It prompts widespread carnage as corporations and cults engage in an arms race and devastate the planet. With news that there are multiple vaults buried all over the planet, the various factions unite under one banner known as Children of the Vault, led by the Calypso twins, Troy and Tyreen Calypso.BorderlandsThe success of Diablo has spawned a number of games as well as genres \u2014 from rogue-likes to hub-based online games. But the biggest takeaway from Blizzard\u2019s hit RPG has been the call of loot. Borderlands is one such game which rose to fame, using the same loot formula to build a fun, first-person-shooter set in a Wild West meets Mad Max science-fiction realm. With its razor-sharp dark humour, it has bravely taken on the industry with extreme success. Despite its flaws, Borderlands 3 is a commercial success, which goes to show Gearbox that their formula works.You play as one of the four vault hunters, Amara, a being of immense power and one of the six Sirens who can manifest multiple arms like an Indian goddess. Then there is FL4K, a robotic beastmaster who controls three pets. Moze is always accompanied by her 10-ton mecha and, as a gunner class, she is proficient with lots of guns. Zane is an operative that specialises in stealth, sabotage and espionage. The characters are fun and have their own styles. So you need to figure out what you want from this game before you choose.The same tongue-in-cheek humour is back and is there throughout the game, from the return of Claptrap, the robot mascot of the game, to the talkative bad guys. Borderlands 2 set the bar high, in terms of antagonists, with Handsome Jack, the ruthless head of the Hyperion Corporation. The Calypsos aren\u2019t as menacing. Thankfully, the game is filled with stuff to shoot \u2014 the machine guns matter more than the narrative in this case. Borderlands 3 Developer: Gearbox SoftwarePublisher: 2K Games Price: \u20b93999 for PC, Xbox One, PS4With your Gatling gun, grenade-launching mech and other mystical arms, you can cause large-scale devastation. The guns themselves are the stars of the show \u2014 the Wild West-themed ones, slick futuristic ones, ones with mounted shields or automated legs and more. You also get guns that burn and freeze your enemies as you scream maniacally.The game\u2019s quests send you mindlessly ricocheting around the map, across several planets, as an excuse to shoot as you gather points, skills and advance to further levels. But the game makes you grind to progress, and it doesn\u2019t help that enemies are bullet sponges, absorbing magazine after magazine before they go down. Hopefully, the makers fix this in the future.To some extent, it feels like you\u2019re living in a cartoon, thanks to the signature cell-shaded style of Borderlands, which looks the same as previous games. If you want a game to breeze through, this is the one for you. With excellent shooter mechanics, lots of loot, and more powers, Borderlands got the update it needed.

      "\n\nA face-off of three interpreter apps for UN International Translation Day \n",
      "Updated: September 23, 2019 21:12 IST\rPublished: September 23, 2019 15:37 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/united-nations-international-translation-day-2019-hi-translate-google-translate-microsoft-translate/article29489377.ece",
      "Few people have the ability to speak multiple languages, a highly underrated life-skill. In the future, however, we might be able to get by, thanks to online translation tools (on cue: \u201cthere\u2019s an app for that!\u201d).Ahead of United Nations\u2019 International Translation Day (September 30) \u2014 which recognises the role translation plays in bringing people together and strengthening verbal communication \u2014 we tested if it is easy to translate English phrases (via text input) into Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi. While there\u2019s a whole host of such apps, Google Translate, Hi Translate by Fun and Hi Tool, Hi Translator for iOS, and Microsoft Translator are the few that support close to six Indian languages \u2014 a lot of the others do not list any at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the book title That Life\u2019s Importance sound? Absurd, isn\u2019t it? This is what Microsoft Translator\u2019s Tamil translation of the book cover of J Krishnamurti\u2019s Education and the Significance of Life reads like. It is a nice feature, but it doesn\u2019t work to the T. It even got the author\u2019s name wrong. This is no laughing matter, but what is, is Google Translate\u2019s Voice feature.When I asked in Tamil the direction to the nearest pharmacy, it said, \u2018Make your way to the drug store\u2019. Not joking. And it is best that I do not mention what it came up with when I asked for help with buses to the railway station. Long story short, don\u2019t use Google\u2019s Voice feature. Among Google Translate\u2019s positive aspects is its Instant mode, in which you can simply point at English words with your camera and get them translated into Tamil. But the app doesn\u2019t support Tamil to English.Microsoft works reasonably better for English to Tamil if you key in the words, though. Hi Translate comes across as a breath of fresh air. There are no gimmicks. No fancy features. Just basic typing \u2014 simply type in Tamil or English and it works fuss-free. On one occasion, it translated \u2018forest\u2019 in Tamil to \u2018wild\u2019 in English. But other than that, it mostly got its Tamil spot on.Ranking: Hi Translate, Google Translate, Microsoft Translator(Akila Kannadasan)\n\n\n\n\n\nI found a Telugu copy of Robin Sharma\u2019s The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Impressively, Google Translate could interpret the book\u2019s title effortlessly. I proceeded to scan a brief news report in Telugu with PV Sindhu and Mary Kom\u2019s picture, and the translated text was quickly ready without any errors. However, it struggles to translate when the font is not similar to its database. For instance, the app couldn\u2019t translate a provision store\u2019s signboard. While translating the phrases, however, we learnt, short and well-structured sentences deliver the best results. Google and Hi Translate tend to translate word-for-word. On two occasions, their results were exactly the same. Hi Translate\u2019s aggressive word-for-word translation engine falters when an English sentence has more than six words. On the other hand, Google handles long sentences well, but the translations are very formal. Despite minor tense-errors on three occasions out of five, Microsoft\u2019s output is more colloquial, often omitting a word. Google\u2019s voice translation is far from perfection In fact, it reminded me of how Google Translate was in the early 2000s: almost unusable. However, if you use simple sentences, it works well. Microsoft has a clever workaround to this problem with a robust phrasebook .Ranking: Google Translate, Microsoft Translator and Hi Translate(Archit Mehta, with inputs from Kishore Koyyalamudi)\n\n\n\n\n\nThree years ago, when I used Google Translate, the app gave me sentences that made no sense. Now, a lot has changed. I am surprised to see the app interchange sentences between English and Kannada with seemingly less effort and more accuracy. Similar is the case for Hi Translate, which is capable of precisely converting longer sentences with grammar in the right place. Though the apps seamlessly translate sentences, the extremely formal translations could make even a hardcore Kannada speaker go scurrying for a dictionary. While in most of the cases the word-for-word translations work fine, at times it changes the meaning of the sentence. For instance, Google translated a board that read \u2018Varsha Travels\u2019 in Kannada to \u2018Travel of the year\u2019. (\u2018Varsha\u2019 in Kannada means a year).Google Translate does not support voice output in Kannada. However, it effortlessly translates Kannada sentences into English. The scan feature in Google Translate works like magic when the app is able to recognise the font. However, it struggles to translate hand-written sentences and gets them wrong most of the times.Ranking: Google Translate, Hi Translate, (Microsoft Translator does not support Kannada translations)(Aishwarya Upadhye)\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon scanning a front-page sidebar on a Malayalam daily using Google Translate, I was surprised to see its accuracy and efficiency. But for some rough edges, the translation of the brief text was pretty much precise, though if you look for word-for-word comparison, a phrase or two was slightly off target. However, the overall picture was clear. I then tried to translate the blurb of a Malayalam version of RK Narayan\u2019s The Man-Eater of Malgudi that packed in some dense usages in a single, long sentence. The translation read like a summary of the text, nevertheless meaningful, as if the app applied its own brain to weed out some elements for the sake of simplification. Larger texts, such as name boards, are unpredictable, perhaps due to unrecognisable fonts. And, Malayalam is not supported in the \u2018instant\u2019 scan feature in Google and the results of its \u2018hand-writing\u2019 feature were generally all over the place.In terms of accuracy in interpretation, there were mixed responses. For one thing, some of the translations were quite formal, if not stilted, while both Google and Hi Translate often threw up similar results as if the same algorithm or intelligence were at work behind the scenes. While shorter sentences were impressive with their correctness, longer ones raised some question marks.Google\u2019s voice translation feature came across as a hit-or-miss affair, but largely usable with common sense. For instance, the word \u2018fare\u2019 (as in charges) in a test phrase from English to regional was misheard or misread or misinterpreted as \u2018fire\u2019 first and then still as \u2018fair\u2019 in successive attempts, processing the translation as \u2018mela\u2019 in Malayalam, thus completely distorting the semantics. Or a serious-sounding Malayalam word for \u2018emergency\u2019 replaced a more colloquial equivalent of \u2018urgent\u2019 Similar story for voice translation from Malayalam to English too. Ranking: Google Translate, Hi Translate, (Microsoft Translator doesn\u2019t yet support Malayalam translations)(Harikumar JS)\n\n\n\n\n\nHindi has its own little idiosyncrasies depending on where you use it \u2014 Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi have obviously very different styles, and it doesn\u2019t take too much effort to pick up on these variations. If, in Delhi, I say \u201cmahoday, kripya uchit kiraya vasoolein,\u201d instead of a variation of \u201cbhaisaab sahi batao, mazaak mat karo\u201d to an autorickshaw driver, I can kiss my hopes of getting a ride for a reasonable price goodbye. The problem with all three apps \u2014 Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and Hi Translator for iOS \u2014 is that they gave more or less the same textbook-Hindi versions of most phrases I asked them to help me with. The text/photo-scan feature on Hi Translator is a pay-only feature, and Microsoft doesn\u2019t offer one at all. But the Google photo-scan feature is nifty, except when there\u2019s even a slight change in typeface. I tried to read a Priyadarshan book Naye Daur Ka Naya Cinema (Cinema of The New Era) published by Vani Prakashan.When I was pointing at the stylised text on the cover, it showed me garbled phrases like \u2018New Mouthful Baa Sibema\u2019. However, it worked seamlessly well with the plain typeface (only, it was a direct translation, which read \u2018new era new cinema\u2019). This will fail if you try to read a whole page through your phone camera, though.Ranking: Hi Translator for iOS (for UI); Google Translate (for photo convenience), Microsoft Translator (Vangmayi Parakala)You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nOwned by China's ByteDance, TikTok is one of the world's most popular apps.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n India's aviation regulator has told airlines to crack down on the behaviour of flight crew after several videos on popular Chinese video app TikTok showed crew members singing and dancing while on duty, a senior official told Reuters.The warning comes after it found growing examples of social media posts, especially on TikTok, featuring flight attendants grooving to popular tunes or lip-syncing movie dialogues while inside an aircraft.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all airlines to rein in such behaviour and will soon seek a compliance report, said a senior official at the department. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok turns one: When one year lapses into 30 seconds...\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTikTok turns one: When one year lapses into 30 seconds...\n\u201cWe have issued instructions and told them these are unbecoming,\u201d a DGCA official said, adding a letter had also been sent to airlines about \u201ctheatrical performances\u201d by crew members that could put passenger safety at risk.A TikTok video showing a SpiceJet cabin crew member smiling and walking down the aisle of an airplane full of passengers was reported by local media this week, drawing criticism from people on social media.SpiceJet Ltd said in a statement on Friday that its crew members were strictly prohibited from shooting pictures or videos onboard and it took strict action against violators. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo clip lands 11 KMC contract staff in trouble \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nVideo clip lands 11 KMC contract staff in trouble AirAsia India said it ensured its staff adhered to strict internal guidelines for social media usage.IndiGo said it had received the communication from the regulator and would take appropriate action where required.Vistara said expectations on employees' use of social media were clearly laid out in its social media guidelines and in the training provided. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n#MyTikTokStory: How TikTok is following YouTube\u2019s steps in advertising \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n#MyTikTokStory: How TikTok is following YouTube\u2019s steps in advertising Owned by China's ByteDance, TikTok is one of the world's most popular apps. It has become a sensation in India, where it has been downloaded more than 350 million times, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.The app allows users to post short videos with special effects. Hashtags such as #crewlife, #flightattendant are often used for videos involving airline crew and have around 170 million views on the platform.This week, Reuters found dozens of videos that showed crew from airlines such as IndiGo, AirAsia India and Vistara, part-owned by Singapore Airlines, singing, dancing or ramp walking along an aircraft's aisle.TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.One TikTok video from a user, who identified herself as \u201c#Dancer #cabincrew #indigo\u201d, showed her and another flight attendant wearing uniform and dancing to a Bollywood song inside a plane and blowing a kiss to the camera.In another video, a TikTok user wearing a shirt with a Vistara logo and a fluorescent safety jacket on top is seen dancing to a popular DJ Snake song on an airport apron, with a plane seen in the background.Earlier this week, Vistara's chief commercial officer Sanjiv Kapoor told staff in an internal email that posting photos inside or outside aircraft that don't meet the company's guidelines was not permitted, and only smart and classy photos that showed the airline in a positive light were allowed.\u201cBut goofy/immature/tacky/cheap \u201ctik-tok type\u201d photos and videos are strictly prohibited,\u201d Mr. Kapoor wrote in his e-mail, seen by Reuters, while also referring to the regulator's recent notice.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSampath Kumar, principal and co-owner, Saraswathi Technical Institute, Tiruchi. Photo: M.Srinath/THE HINDU\n\u00a0 As students clock in for the post-lunch session at the Saraswathi Technical Institute in Puthur, Tiruchi, the hall slowly fills up with the \u2018clackety-clack\u2019 of 55 manual typewriters. For S Sampath Kumar, the principal and co-owner of the school started in 1952 by his father A Srinivasan, the sound is proof that the typewriter has saved itself from becoming obsolete, at least in Tamil Nadu.\u201cThere was a brief drop in our market in 2002 when desktop computers overtook the manual typewriters in all offices. But after the State government made typing skills mandatory for public service postings, we were able to regain our lost clientele. Most government exams grant 20 bonus marks to candidates who have completed an English or Tamil typing certificate course,\u201d says Sampath.As a result, his school sees nearly 200 students per year, attempting the Junior (30 words per minute) or Senior (45 words per minute) six-month certificate courses in typing.Tapping awayIn 1955, Mumbai-based Godrej & Boyce (at the behest of then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru) manufactured its first \u2018Prima\u2019 brand of typewriter, making India the first Asian country to produce its own writing machine in a market monopolised by foreign brands like Remington, Underwood and Olivetti.The Godrej Prima, which had 1800 components, was a big hit as an essential piece of office equipment, and was among India\u2019s first products to be exported.Typing became a sought-after skill for women in the 1960s and \u201970s, as it helped them to enter the job market.The 1990s heralded the \u2018Ice Age\u2019 of manual and electrical typewriters, as desktop publishing (DTP) and digital technology upended the existing paper-driven model of working worldwide.\u201cTypewriters started turning up in junkyards. In fact, I picked my three samples from the trash,\u201d says P Vijaykumar, a collector of antiques, coins and stamps in Tiruchi.In Tamil Nadu, the manual typewriter\u2019s revival has been scripted by public and private sector initiatives. That\u2019s why, while many of the DTP and Internet browsing centres that opened in the early 2000s have closed down due to changing technology trends, the manual typewriter is back in vogue. The typewriter\u2019s \u2018QWERTY\u2019 keyboard that has been replicated in electronic devices has helped it to stay relevant, say industry players.\u201cComputer centres often send their staff to us because electronic soft-touch keyboards get damaged faster than manual ones, when you don\u2019t know how to type,\u201d says Sampath Kumar. \u201cBesides being accessible to students from Class 6 onwards, manual typing also teaches the typist how to spell words accurately. Our first lesson, after the history of typewriters, is to type the months of the year correctly.\u201dEducational institutions like the Bharathiyar University in Coimbatore have made it compulsory for students to learn typing as part of their curriculum. Memories are made of thisRajesh Sharma, 63, remembers growing up with typewriters in his native city of Indore in Madhya Pradesh, as his father Madhav Prasad used to run a job typing centre outside the District Court there. \u201cMy elder brother Bhanu Prakash, who is now 74, used to work with our father on the Remington Quiet Riter, and typing used to be the only source of earning for our family,\u201d the advertising professional says in an email interview.To show his gratitude to his late father and brother, Rajesh has set up the \u2018Madhav Bhanu Typewriters Museum\u2019 in a section of his home in Indore, showcasing machines that he has collected from 2012. \u201cI started with 8 machines, and today the collection has grown to over 325 typewriters (manual, electric and electronic) from 1900 to 2000. Some of the brands that I have are Mercedes Std, Olivetti\u2013Studio, Lexicana, Graphika, Letterra, Facit, Halda and Scheidegger,\u201d he writes. The museum also has a Facebook page.\u201cThe typewriter is possibly the only invention that was accepted and adopted by all the countries in their languages,\u201d he says.Hopeful of establishing a public museum for the typewriter in Indore, Rajesh has been contacting companies who are willing to sponsor display areas. \u201cMore than 90 typewriters in my collection are gifts from the owners or their family members. A museum will give a new life to these wonderful machines,\u201d he writes.The increasing emphasis on typing and correspondence skills in government offices has led to a fresh demand for people who can handle electronic and paper-based typing simultaneously.The Directorate of Technical Education (DOTE) conducts the \u2018Computer on Office Automation\u2019 (COA) certificate course for students who have qualified in manual typing, to learn how to transfer their skills to electronic media. \u201cThe Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNSPC) exams have created over 5,000 job openings per year. At least 2 lakh students attempt them once every six months,\u201d says M Sathish Kumar, the Tiruchi coordinator of Tamil Nadu Typewriting Computer Institutes\u2019 Association (TNTCIA). Launched in 2015, the industry grouping has 783 government-approved institutes on its rolls, that train students in typing and shorthand. Around 20 schools from Tiruchi district are part of TNTCIA.\u201cWe also cater to private Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies who ask us to train their fresh recruits in typing before they start work,\u201d says Sathish Kumar, who runs a technical institute in Thuvakudi. \u201cThose who have learned on a manual typewriter can easily adapt to an electronic keyboard. And with starting salaries of \u20b915,000 to \u20b918,000, typing has become an attractive job opportunity, especially for those from economically poor sections of society.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nG Manohar, among the last Godrej-trained typewriter mechanics working in Tiruchi. Photo: M.Srinath/THE HINDU\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manual typewriter is reliving its boom in Tamil Nadu with just used machines. Godrej and Boyce stopped manufacturing typewriters in 2009, so users have had to make do with secondhand machines, that in turn require specialist mechanics for maintenance.\u201cTyping was a novelty in my school days, so my father, who ran a photo studio then, asked me to learn it,\u201d says G Manohar, 59, among the last Godrej-trained typewriter repairers in Tiruchi. \u201cUsually we buy used machines for \u20b94000, and sell the repaired versions to institutes for \u20b97000,\u201d he says.He manages to rotate spares between English typewriters, but says that those for Tamil machines are hard to find. \u201cThe high demand for Tamil typewriters has led to a huge price rise \u2014 a secondhand machine can cost up to \u20b924,000,\u201d he says.Most of the machines need an overhaul at least once a month, says Sampath Kumar, who also cuts and winds the Kores brand 60-meter cotton cloth ribbon for his typewriters on black metal spools. \u201cThe lint from the ribbon and the dust in the air can jam up the keys,\u201d he says. \u201cBut despite all these hurdles, we are sure that typing will remain an essential skill for many more generations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRajesh Sharma a typewriter collector based in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.

      "\n\nHindi second-most used \u2018Assistant\u2019 language globally, says Google \n",
      "Updated: September 20, 2019 14:29 IST\rPublished: September 20, 2019 14:27 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/hindi-second-most-used-assistant-language-globally-says-google/article29467494.ece",
      " Hindi has emerged as the second-most used language globally on Google Assistant, the tech giant\u2019s artificial intelligence powered assistant, behind just English, according to the tech giant. The company, which has been working on supporting Indic languages across its products like Search, Lens and others on its platform, said it will soon make Google Assistant available in Hindi on all Android TVs.\u201cSince introducing the Assistant in India nearly two years ago, we\u2019ve introduced Hindi and 8 additional Indic languages...We\u2019re thrilled to share that Hindi has become the second most used Assistant language globally after English across many types of devices in India...coming soon, the Assistant will also be available in Hindi on all Android TVs,\u201d Google Vice President, Product Management, Manuel Bronstein said. He added that Indians have been using \u201cthe power of voice\u201d to do a variety of things like finding information to help with homework, getting train schedules, among others. Interestingly, last year, Google had said its voice-based assistant had received about 4.5 lakh proposals for marriage in India. While Google didn\u2019t share the number of people using Assistant (which competes with Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa), it said the product is available in over 30 languages across 80 countries. Google said starting today, users can talk to Assistant in Hindi by simply saying \u201cHey Google, talk to me in Hindi\u201d across all Android, Android Go and KaiOS devices. Previously, users needed to activate Hindi language support from the settings option. Tech companies like Google and Amazon are betting on vernacular languages as reports suggest that 90 per cent of new internet users in India are native language speakers. This makes it imperative for these tech companies to offer rich experience in local languages in India that is witnessing strong growth in internet usage as well as consumption of connected devices. On Wednesday, Amazon had announced that users in India can now speak to its voice assistant Alexa in Hindi to carry out tasks like checking cricket scores, requesting songs and even asking how she\u2019s doing. Launched in India in 2017, Alexa was able to understand and pronounce names of popular places, names and songs in regional languages like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Punjabi but supported commands only in English. It had also hinted at support coming in for other Indic languages. Apart from Assistant, Google is adding more Indian languages to its other products. Discover, its news feed app launched last year, will soon support Oriya, Urdu and Punjabi. Google Lens, which allows people to search for information, ask questions and translate text by pointing their phone\u2019s camera at things, will now support Tamil, Telugu and Marathi as well. Its Bolo app, a speech-based product that helps children learn how to read, will support Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu as well now.\u201cBolo has already helped 800,000 young Indians read stories more than three million times and speak half a billion words. We are working with partners like Saajha, the Kaivalya Education Foundation, Pratham Education Foundation and Room to Read, and looking forward to making it available to even more Indian families,\u201d Google Director of Marketing (Southeast Asia and India) Sapna Chadha said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAccess to Internet is a basic right, says Kerala High Court\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/access-to-internet-is-a-basic-right-says-kerala-high-court/article29462339.ece",
      " The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that the right to have access to the Internet is part of the fundamental right to education as well as the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.Justice P.V. Asha made the observation while ordering the Principal of Sree Narayanaguru College, Kozhikode, to re-admit a student who had been expelled from the college hostel for using her mobile phone beyond the restricted hours.The court observed, \u201cWhen the Human Rights Council of the United Nations has found that the right of access to Internet is a fundamental freedom and a tool to ensure right to education, a rule or instruction which impairs the said right of the students cannot be permitted to stand in the eye of law.\u201dThe verdict came on a petition filed by Faheema Shirin, a third-semester B.A. English student of the college at Chelanur, challenging her expulsion for not adhering to restrictions on the use of mobile phone. As per the rules of the girls\u2019 hostel, inmates were restrained from using mobile phones from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. every day. She, along with a few other inmates, had protested against the restriction, as it was hampering their learning process. She contended that the use of mobile phones amounted to a violation of fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. In fact, the internet, accessiblethrough mobile phones or laptops, provided an avenue for the students to gather knowledge.The Judge observed that the action of the college authorities infringed the fundamental freedom as well as privacy and would adversely affect the future and career of students who want to acquire knowledge and compete with their peers, suchrestriction could not be permitted to be enforced.The court while citing the observations of the SupremeCourt in the S.Rengarajan and others v. P. Jagjivan Ram (1989) case said t \u201c the fundamental freedom under Article 19(1)(a) can be reasonably restricted only for the purposes mentioned in Article 19(2) and the restriction must be justified on the anvil of necessity and not the quicksand of convenience or expediency.\u201dThe court added that the hostel authorities were expected to enforce only those rules and regulations for enforcing discipline. Enforcement of discipline shall not be by blocking the ways and means of the students to acquire knowledgeThe court further said that college authorities as well as parents should be conscious of the fact that the students in a college hostel are adults capable of taking decisions as to how and when they have to study.

      "\n\nThis Italian entrepreneur builds wood-fired ovens all over the country\n\n",
      "Updated: September 19, 2019 14:34 IST\rPublished: September 19, 2019 14:34 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/marco-cappiottis-business-il-forno-by-marco-wood-fired-ovens/article29456835.ece",
      "\nMarco Cappiotti with one of his creations\n\u00a0  The first time I heard about, Il Forno by Marco, a wood-fired oven-making business, was through Hyderabad\u2019s Zza Bar. Zza bar uses mango-wood in their too-hot-to-stand-by ovens, which adds a delicate flavour to the base and doesn\u2019t take away from the essence of a good and true pizza. Marco Cappiotti also made a portable oven in a truck for the restaurant so Zza Bar can cater at parties or go to food truck festivals.Srini Uppuluri of Zza Bar says the process was long and tough, but Marco persevered until it was complete and perfect right down to wheels. Marco, in turn, says he loves working with passionate restaurateurs rather than the quotidian businessman, as it engenders a stronger pizza movement across India.Marco\u2019s oven countHyderabad: 3, Delhi: 20, Mumbai: 5, Bengaluru: 10, Chennai: 3, many more in tier 2 cities Marco\u2019s love for authentic pizza is part of what drives his business of making these ovens for businesses all over the country. The proverbial cup which hold the energy of this Delhi-dwelling Italian transplant truly runneth over and it\u2019s evident as he talks about his journey. In 1994, Marco and his family emigrated to India, choosing the cool relief and verdant surroundings of Manali as their restaurant\u2019s nesting ground. Barely in full \u2018adulting mode\u2019, Marco watched as his father and a friend made a wood-fired oven by hand. \u201cPeople there were already interested and curious about the oven, with many wanting one for themselves. When I was about 20 years old, I started to make a few,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand I kept upgrading our existing one with new improvements. So this was borne out of passion.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Cappiotti\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually the family\u2019s restaurant changed hands and Marco moved to Delhi with the mindset of turning this activity into a business, teaming up with a supplier in Gujarat for the not-so-widely available materials. \u201cI got to know some people in Delhi who were in the same industry as me and I started working as an oven-maker. Soon everything was scaled up. Around four years ago, I started hiring people. I also created my online presence, so for the last three years, I\u2019ve been doing this for major metro cities and more recently, for tier-2 cities as well, which shows the awareness and concept growth. It\u2019s not a niche thing, of course.\u201d Marco currently has a factory in Delhi and travels two or three times a month for wood-fired oven installations, all of which have that well-known dome for convection of heat, while the exterior is customised as per the surrounding environment. Many are painted a solid colour over the stucco, while others have mosaical tile-work of quirky designs. What of unconventional wood-fired pizza ovens? He recalls one client in Bengaluru who wanted him to construct a rotating wood-fired oven, similar to a microwave oven. \u201cThere were a lot of structural challenges and while keeping to the true nature of the ovens I make, I had to make it work. I don\u2019t get a lot of, so to speak, adventurous requests but this was something different.\u201d Naturally, the idea of cost comes to mind; a creation from Il Forno by Marco can range between \u20b960,000 and \u20b94,00,000. \n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Cappiotti presenting a fresh pizza made in one of his wood-fired ovens \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco doesn\u2019t suggest making your own wood-fired ovens as it requires very specific materials and the process demands a lot of science acumen coupled with pragmatism as well as years of experience. Maintenance of a wood-fired oven is no small feat either, given it needs round-the-clock care. They are preferred as they cook breads, vegetables and fruits quickly while, helping them retain specific nutrients and antioxidants. There are other expert players doing what Marco does, so moving the industry along enriches the pizza game all the more.A regular oven, however, don\u2019t have the same effect a wood-fired oven does. First off, there\u2019s the added delicious smokiness to the flavour profile. Most regular ovens don\u2019t reach the higher temperature parameter so only certain pizza crusts can be pulled off. It\u2019s worth pointing out, though, that a wood-fired oven isn\u2019t exactly eco-friendly given the amount of wood or fossil fuels with which it operates. The heat generation is also runs between 575 to around 800 degrees Centigrade, making it a safety concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Cappiotti with one of his ovens, finished with customised designs \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, Marco explains that the pizza IQ of India has evolved tremendously over the years he\u2019s been living here. \u201cFifteen or 20 years ago, pizza wasn\u2019t authentic, it was literal junk. Some expats in Delhi and Goa were trying to do something more authentic with the flavours. Between 2005 and 2010, people starting opting for Pizza Hut and Domino\u2019s as their go-to. In the metro cities, though, lot of places coming up were doing only thin crust which was considered gourmet, but is actually just more international,\u201d he says.He explains, \u201cIn the last two to three years, more places are doing good quality Neopolitan pizzas. Now people look down at thin crust, preferring puffier and more moist crusts from fermented and flavourful bases.More people don\u2019t mind paying double the price if they know they\u2019re eating premium pizza and the way it\u2019s made is also a talking point.\u201d Exhibitionism in the kitchen has become a thing of the present; people love watching their food being made and plated. Pizza ovens, however old and timeless they are, offer just that.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

File photo\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is on Capitol Hill this week to meet with senators as the social media giant faces scrutiny from both the Federal Trade Commission and members of Congress, the company confirmed on Wednesday.Mr. Zuckerberg will be in Washington to \u201ctalk about future internet regulation\u201d with policymakers but has no public events planned, Facebook said in a statement.Mr. Zuckerberg is holding meetings late Wednesday and on Thursday on Capitol Hill. A person briefed on the matter said he was also expected to hold meetings with the Trump administration. A White House spokesman did not immediately comment.It is Mr. Zuckerberg 's first trip to Washington since April 2018, when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from nearly 100 U.S. lawmakers over privacy issues and potential regulation.Facebook, which agreed to a record-setting $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over privacy practices in July, also faces antitrust investigations by the FTC and a group of state attorneys general.The FTC privacy probe was triggered last year by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The consultancys clients included Trumps 2016 election campaign.The worlds largest social media network has also drawn ire from Capitol Hill after it announced plans in June to launch the Libra crypto currency as it expands into e-commerce. The project, comprised of a consortium of financial firms based in Switzerland, is scheduled to launch in 2020.Regulators, central banks and politicians in the United States and Europe worry that Libra has the potential to upend the world financial system, harm privacy and foster money laundering.Facebook faces scrutiny from lawmakers on a wide range of issues, including privacy, market power, efforts to combat extremism online, preventing foreign interference in campaigns, and accusations of political bias.The company is also being probed by a group of state attorneys general led by New York.Once lauded as engines of economic growth, the companies in social media, internet search, e-commerce and other digital technologies have increasingly been on the defensive over lapses such as privacy breaches and their outsized market influence.Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp, has more than 1.5 billion daily users.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

With this update, users in India will be able to interact with Alexa using Hindi (and Hinglish) as opposed to only English at present.Till now, Alexa, which was launched in India in 2017, was able to understand and pronounce names of popular places, names and songs in regional languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Punjabi, but supported commands only in English.\u201cOur goal is that Alexa should be a native citizen. With this update, Alexa can now understand customers speaking to her completely in Hindi or Hinglish, in multiple contexts and varied regional accents and dialects,\u201d said Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist, Alexa AI, Amazon. Stating that India had uniquely challenged the firm\u2019s AI teams with its cultural and linguistic diversity, Mr. Prasad added that many Indian users contributed to Hindi development through the Cleo skill on Alexa. He also indicated that more regional languages could be added to Alexa in the future.\u201cIn India, pronunciation, diction and accents in Hindi are different across the country even if the language being spoken is the same... With today\u2019s launch, Alexa becomes more local. Alexa will not only understand and respond in Hindi or Hinglish but is also armed with knowledge about topics that interests users in the country,\u201d said Puneesh Kumar, country manager, Alexa Experience and Devices, Amazon India, said.Amazon said about 500 skills \u2014 which is the term for various things that Alexa can do such as playing music, bringing up news, stories or giving weather forecasts \u2014 are available in Hindi and more will be added.Mr. Prasad said overall, there were over 90,000 Alexa skills of which about 30,000 were India-specific.Alexa, which competes with digital assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri and the Google Assistant, powers the Amazon Echo range of home-assistance devices besides products from brands such as Bose, MyBox, and Syska.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nMy home, their art, all digital\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/eikowa-online-visualisation-tool-for-buying-art-for-the-home/article29446986.ece",
      "\nA woman uses the Eikowa visualisation tool for art-works\n\u00a0 Imagine being able to bring a Monet into your drawing room at the click of a mouse. Online galleries are constantly evolving their platforms in every possible manner, to meet the growing needs of the tech-savvy art connoisseur. One such reinvention is what online art gallery Eikowa has turned to recently: where a rendering engine allows patrons to visualise how the art will look in their homes, without having to make the effort to visit the gallery... because who really \u2018goes to the store\u2019 these days? Launched in 2015, Eikowa took form as a library of contemporary Indian artists\u2019 works (mostly paintings), which later on expanded into sculptures, glass works and other media. The platform does not discriminate against self-taught artists, and all that matters is \u201chow serious they are about their profession\u201d, according to founder Vaishnavi Murali, whose arts career has taken off since she was 19.\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the Eikowa online facility \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, in fact, one of the first steps towards democratising art. Making them digitally available for users is another, while having them bring the art-work to the comfort of one\u2019s home is a step higher.So, what led to the inception of this tool? Vaishnavi explains: \u201cWhile seeing is important, essentially you get to experience the texture and detailing of the work. To see it against context is the most important factor. And a picture kept in the gallery, set under the lights, would not look the same when set up at home. Which is why we send the gallery to wherever you are.\u201dHow to use 2. Go to any painting and go to the page that shows all details of that painting.3. Click on \u2018view in my home\u2019 (you will be asked to log in).4. Add an image of the wall and feed the wall height as 10 or 12 feet. (If you don\u2019t have an image, you can choose a default image from a bunch there). Click on process.5. You will land on a page where you can see the painting on the wall. Adjust the painting and choose the frames and colours accordingly.It is also easier for one to make a decision, she says. There are customers who always ask them for suggestions and tips regarding the context, for whom this tool would seem effective. \u201cEarlier, we would use Photoshop and Powerpoint, superimpose the painting and show it to them. Now, they can narrow down the choice themselves before purchasing,\u201d Vaishnavi says.\u201cThe feature is a mix of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. AR is currently app-based, but we did not want to implement it as an app. Users are already bogged down by a number of apps on their phones. Also, the phone would have a small screen and hence is inconvenient \u2014 we particularly made it in such a way that it is integrated with the website. And, AR has to have a marker to recognise the wall and the area, which would mean something has to be stuck on the wall for it to identify, which is not very user-friendly,\u201d continues Vaishnavi, about the initial challenges that the in-house development faced. This is also the reason why they have been dabbling with the idea for the past two years."

      "The alleged suspension of several Twitter accounts belonging to Jana Sena Party activists has triggered outrage among party followers, on Tuesday.In no time they took to the same platform to express their ire and blamed the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments for the \u2018mass suspension\u2019 of the accounts which were behind the \u2018Save Nallamala\u2019 campaign initiated by party chief Pawan Kalyan. In a matter of hours, the party\u2019s rank and file made the hashtag \u2018#BringbackJSPSocialMedia\u2019 trend at second position with close to 90, 000 tweets on Twitter\u2019s India trends chart as of 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday.

These accounts altogether have lakhs of followers and promote the activities of Jana Sena Party extensively. Party activists allege that hundreds of accounts have been suspended so far and appeals are being made to the Twitter heads in the country. \u201cIt is completely unfair to suspend the Twitter handles of JSP-related accounts. We request Manish Maheswari [MD, Twitter India] to consider this as a serious issue and lift suspension immediately,\u201d wrote a user Prasad.

      "\nPhoto for representation.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Scientists have developed new machine learning algorithms which can successfully identify bullies and aggressors on Twitter with 90% accuracy. Effective tools for detecting harmful actions on social media are scarce, as this type of behaviour is often ambiguous in nature and exhibited via seemingly superficial comments and criticisms, said researchers from Binghamton University in the U.S. The study, published in the journal Transactions on the Web, analysed the behavioral patterns exhibited by abusive Twitter users and their differences from other Twitter users.\u201cWe built crawlers\u2014 programmes that collect data from Twitter via variety of mechanisms,\u201d said Binghamton University computer scientist Jeremy Blackburn.\u201cWe gathered tweets of Twitter users, their profiles, as well as (social) network-related things, like who they follow and who follows them,\u201d Mr. Blackburn said. The researchers then performed natural language processing and sentiment analysis on the tweets themselves, as well as a variety of social network analyses on the connections between users. The researchers developed algorithms to automatically classify two specific types of offensive online behaviour- cyberbullying and cyberaggression. The algorithms were able to identify abusive users on Twitter with 90% accuracy, researchers said. These are users who engage in harassing behaviour, for example, those who send death threats or make racist remarks to users.\u201cIn a nutshell, the algorithms \u2018learn\u2019 how to tell the difference between bullies and typical users by weighing certain features as they are shown more examples,\u201d said Mr. Blackburn. While this research can help mitigate cyberbullying, it is only a first step, he said.\u201cOne of the biggest issues with cyber safety problems is the damage being done is to humans, and is very difficult to \u2018undo,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cFor example, our research indicates that machine learning can be used to automatically detect users that are cyberbullies, and thus could help Twitter and other social media platforms remove problematic users,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, such a system is ultimately reactive: it does not inherently prevent bullying actions, it just identifies them taking place at scale.And the unfortunate truth is that even if bullying accounts are deleted, even if all their previous attacks are deleted, the victims still saw and were potentially affected by them\u201d.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Recently a Vadodara-based insurance agent, Ram Shah, made it to the news for sticking his driver\u2019s licence and other vehicle documents to his helmet and his bike, after the imposition of heavy fines for flouting traffic rules. What a way to make police officers rethink pulling you over. You too could avoid fines but in a smarter way.\u201cFor non-commercial vehicles, we are checking insurance papers and pollution certificate apart from the driver\u2019s licence and registration certificate. We are accepting virtual licences, though most commuters are seen presenting the physical copy of their documents. For commercial vehicles, we also check their permit and fitness certificate,\u201d says GC Rajaratnam, Deputy Transport Commissioner of Visakhapatnam district.Carrying a Driving Licence (DL) and Registration Certificate (RC) along is old school; you can carry them in your smartphones through government-launched mobile applications, DigiLocker and mParivahan. Both these applications allow you to store your documents virtually.As per the lawThe Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) issued an advisory to the States last year to accept Driving Licence, Registration Certificate or other documents in \u2018electronic form\u2019, presented through platforms DigiLocker and mParivahan, as valid under Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. People can show these virtual copies on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorised by the State Government in this behalf.The government launched DigiLocker in July 2015 under its Digital India initiative. The app allows the registered users to store documents and certificates like driving licence, vehicle registration in digital format.To store your licence details in DigiLocker, download the app from Google Playstore or iOS App Store. You can sign in through a One Time Password-based verification process. Scanned copies of the licence and other documents can be uploaded in pdf, jpg, jpeg, png, bmp and gif file types in this cloud-based app.The statistics on DigiLocker\u2019s official website states that there are over 28.12 million users. Maharashtra, with 14,44,295 users, has the highest number of registered users, followed by Uttar Pradesh (11,60,411) and Tamil Nadu (8,38,552). mParivahan app was launched by transport minister Nitin Gadkari in January 2017. The app is available for android users on Google Playstore. You can register your mobile number through an OTP-based verification process. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe app, which has over five million downloads on Playstore, allows its registered users to create a virtual copy of their RC and DL.A copy of your RC can be made by entering your chassis number and engine number. Similarly, the app will ask for your date of birth to create a virtual copy of your driver\u2019s licence. The virtual copies can be downloaded and stored for offline usage. They also allow you to generate QR codes for RC and DL, which can be printed and pasted on the vehicle. Ideal if you like to flaunt your documents like Ram.The users can also procure details like the name of the owner, date of registration, age of the vehicle by entering the car number.

      "\nLit up signage at the Taobao Maker Festival \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement  If you get lost at the Taobao Maker Festival \u2014 which you might, considering it is held at the Hangzhou Boiler Factory in Hangzhou, spread across six grounds, featuring over 1,000 products \u2014 look for the black tree. Paper-thin foldable screens fluttering from its branches, the tree marks the beginning of the Tech zone.If you\u2019re curious\u2026The Taobao Maker Festival this year kicked off on September 12. The event spans two weeks and is staged at two venues in Alibaba\u2019s nesting grounds: the Hangzhou Boiler Factory and the West Lake.The festival, organised annually by the Alibaba Group to encourage innovators and shift from a \u2018made in China\u2019 tag to \u2018designed in China\u2019, has six zones: Technology, Chinese culture, Gen-Z trends, Design, Food and Creativity. \u201cEvery year, the Tech zone has always got the most attention. The passion for innovation here is strong, especially in the younger generation,\u201d says Chris Tung, Chief Marketing Officer, Alibaba.Each zone differs in its design as well as background music \u2014 technology is awash in a futuristic blue, with robots, Artificial Intelligence and wearables (watch out for 3D printed sneakers and colour-changing shirts) getting the lion\u2019s share of the pie. Here are five innovations that stood out at the Taobao Maker Festival.Swimming with sharks can be fun, if done at Robosea\u2019s exhibition. The underwater robotics company displayed products such as the Robo-shark, BIKI, and the Sea-flyer. As one of the team members, clad in a bathing suit, enters the makeshift pool holding the robot shark, the crew explains, \u201cThis is an underwater robot which can be customised for research purposes, like monitoring the water quality and ocean engineering. It can identify a target and move towards it. It could be paired up with other devices such as a mechanical arm, for greater functionality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRobosea\u2019s Robo-shark\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Robo-shark\u2019s motion is bionic \u2014 it moves by imitating the three-joint tail fin movements instead of using a propeller. This increases speed and reduces noise. Its shell is also made out of sound-absorbing material for easier disguise.The diver swimming with this shark is accompanied by the BIKI robot fish, which we are told, \u201cis like an underwater drone for the sea.\u201d It can take pictures underwater, move 360 degrees, and avoid obstacles.Wangchao dropped out of university to start C-Exoskeleton Technology \u2014 all because of his fascination with bringing Tony Stark\u2019s Iron Man to life. At the Taobao Maker Festival, he displays the result of this passion: a body suit that helps him lift a 1.2-tonne car through pneumatics.\u201cI built this exoskeleton to help with logistics, mainly for people working in warehouses. They repeat similar movements again and again, so the exoskeleton will help reduce injuries,\u201d says Wangchao.\n\n\n\n\n\nWangchao\u2019s C-Exoskeleton Technology \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nWearing the exoskeleton like a backpack, he straps on the gloves attached by an elastic cord, and begins to hoist a barbell, after explaining, \u201cThe back contains the energy section of the equipment, and it pulls the gloves towards itself, reducing human effort.\u201dBut why exoskeletons, when machines can do the same work? \u201cIn China, manpower is cheap. So we have a lot of workers. An exoskeleton would be the middle-ground option to increase efficiency while keeping costs low,\u201d he says. A self-proclaimed fan of Elon Musk, he adds that the exoskeleton was a small part in his long-term goal to improve human efficiency.There is a lot of buzz about Samsung Galaxy Fold, set to be relaunched later this year. However, Royole got there first last year with FlexiPai, the first foldable phone. Despite opening up to middling reviews by the tech community, there\u2019s something to be said about Royole\u2019s work in thin, flexible and wearable screens.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyole\u2019s FlexiPai\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nHere at the festival, the company has put up, along with other displays, a tree with wearable screens hanging down its branches. These screens can be worn on a shirt, or hats, or added on to bags and other accessories. \u201cThey can be worn by dancers and performers, or they can be used in advertising and PR,\u201d says Tiffany Lyu, Senior Business Development Manager at Royole.\n\n\n\n\n\nYobotics\u2019 robot pet puppy \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nThe robotic pet section by Yobotics has adults turned into cooing children, scratching plastic ears and booping glass noses.The goodest-boy on display today has inquisitive round eyes, circled in green, a wagging tail and a propensity for scratches. \u201cThe dog is connected to a mobile programme on your mobile screen. It captures images through a camera on its nose,\u201d informs a Yobotics team member operating the dogs. It responds to sounds and moves in their direction as well, cocking its head and sitting when required. The dog is being launched next year, and is targeted at families, especially children and senior citizens. \u201cWe have left some of the customisation open to customers. Children can learn how to programme the robot\u2019s functions via some easy codes,\u201d he says.Walking for hours exploring the festival is enough to make one thirsty. Lucky for us, Yangzhou Zhiying\u2019s Super Mix robot has turned bartender for the day.You need to order what you want on a connected app, and leave the rest to the robot \u2014 a giant three-jointed mechanical arm with two grippers and a third extension at its end.\n\n\n\n\n\nYangzhou Zhiying\u2019s Super Mix robot\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nThe robot picks up a steel jar, washes it and places it under a dripper to collect the alcohol and mixers. The third extension acts as the jar\u2019s lid, snapping it shut to begin the crux of the job \u2014 the mixing. Swaying maniacally, through different degrees of freedom, it concocts the mixture before slowing down to pour the drink out in a glass.But wait, the job isn\u2019t done yet: it goes back to wash the jar and put it back in its place.

      "\nScreengrab from Superhot \u00a0 Lego has got their video game formula down to the T. While it may seem repetitive if you\u2019ve played all of their franchise games, it is still entertaining. Combine that with dinosaurs from Jurassic World and you have a winner. Lego Jurassic WorldDeveloper: TT FusionPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPrice: Approx \u20b92800 for Nintendo SwitchWhat\u2019s it about?The recipe is simple: take healthy doses of the popular Jurassic Park and Jurassic World franchises, throw them into a blender with some crazy sauce and you have Lego Jurassic World... plus, throw in a re-telling of the films with a whole lot of slapstick humour, along with its delightful takes on Ian Malcolm, Owen Grady, Dr Alan Grant and the rest of the cast. Given that the game covers the best movies in the franchises, what they\u2019ve done with it is fun and light-hearted. In a blast from the past, Mr DNA, the cartoon tour guide, makes his comeback here, too. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it play?While all the voice-actors have done a great job, the stars of any Jurassic adventure are, undoubtedly, the dinosaurs. Let\u2019s just get down to the best part of the game. Selecting your dinosaur from a list of those which have appeared in the movie and going on a rampage with it.

      "\nFacebook's new policy came over complaints that advertisers might be able to deceptively modify the content in news stories shared on the huge social network. | File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Getty Images Facebook said Monday it is working to stop advertisers from changing headlines in links to news stories after concerns raised by a British political party's altering of one such link.The leading social network confirmed the internal effort in the face of concerns over a BBC headline altered in an ad to evidently change the tone of an article about British government spending on education.\"We are working to put safeguards in place by the end of the year to ensure publishers have control over the way their headlines appear in advertisements,\" Facebook said in response to an AFP inquiry.The new policy came over complaints that advertisers might be able to deceptively modify the content in news stories shared on the huge social network.A recent Conservative Party Facebook ad \"seems to have altered the headline of a BBC News article on an education spending announcement to make the government appear more generous than it is being,\" British fact-checking charity organization Full Fact said in an online post.The fact-check group said the altered headline was \"misleading\" by making the funding \"seem comparatively much larger than it really is.\"Facebook and other internet firms have been under pressure to prevent their online platforms from being used to for deception or social manipulation, particularly regarding political issues.Ads that appear crafted to deceive are typically removed from Facebook, but remain for as long as seven years in the social network's ad library.The move comes with Facebook acting on several fronts to curb efforts to manipulate content and opinion on political issues.Stealth campaigns linked to Russia that used online social networks and other platforms were tailored to sway voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election that put Donald Trump in the White House.The social network last month tightened rules for political ad spending in US elections, notably by requiring more information about who is paying for campaign messages.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAn \u2018Angel\u2019 that protects social media users from online toxicity\n\n",

      "In a world when youngsters are connected to social medial all the time, it becomes difficult to insulate oneself from online vitriolic content. But now using latest technology, researchers and faculty at the International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad are working on a solution that seeks to protect them from such toxicity.As a part of Project Angel, Vasudeva Varma from IIIT-H\u2019s Information Retrieval and Extraction Lab, says researchers spoke to several female respondents across cities. The work also entailed online surveys, among other information gathering techniques. The idea, he says, is to use artificial intelligence, machine learning and neuro-lingusitic programming to trawl social media, scrape certain words, phrases and sentences, which are akin to bullying, and protect users from it.\u201cSpending a lot of time online takes away productivity and the joys of regular life offline. In addition to that, online world is toxic as people here become much more aggressive. One kind of toxic behaviour online is body shaming. It\u2019s one the biggest reasons why girls get into depression. If somebody makes derogatory comments on their body, it is of course a sensitive matter for them,\u201d Prof. Varma says.It is a natural course of action for IIIT-H to embark on Project Angel. For, in the past, the premier institution has developed a technology that detects hate speech.\u201cThis \u2018Angel\u2019 will sit on your social network \u2013 be it Instagram, Twitter or Facebook \u2013 and will understand what content you a producing, and the content you are consuming. The user has to \u2018follow\u2019 the \u2018Angel\u2019. It is an intelligent software that understands content. It will try to estimate if you\u2019re getting into any \u2018trouble\u2019, meaning it can detect whether anybody is harassing you or body shaming or putting you down,\u201d Prof. Varma explains. The first phase entails the Angel \u2018listening\u2019 to the conversation that improves its understanding of the content. The second deals with the right interventions at the right time and would start communicating with the user, discouraging her from further engagement with a toxic message. The third phase involves developing an online social network in which those in trouble can connect with counsellors or those who have dealt with online toxicity. \u201cWe are focusing on Instagram where this \u2018Angel\u2019 will be rolled out as it is a popular platform among teenage girls,\u201d says Prof. Varma. The Angel will then be launched on other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe endearing pull-train of Ganeshas with various technology company logos at Hussainsagar on the final day of immersions\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSanjay Borra\n  It\u2019s no secret that Hyderabad has become one of the world\u2019s hubs for tech conglomerates. What better way to commemorate that than through the intense and colourful celebrations of Ganesh Chathurthi? Tank Bund, needless to say, becomes incredibly manic during this time, so when a group of young men cleared up a line of space in the busy street and used old fabrics as barriers, people were naturally curious what the big deal was. Those who managed to get a glimpse into the space could see a little manually-pulled carriage and 28 Ganesh idols, each with a tech logo attached to their little carriage. Tech companies mentioned included Snapchat, Jio, RedBus, Google Chrome, Twitter and Zomato. It\u2019s a neat concept: Ganesha is the god of knowledge and wisdom so it\u2019s an ideal way to celebrate how technology in Hyderabad is fast-paced. The delight of the on-lookers was unparalleled with many exclaiming, \u201cHow cute and cool!\u201d or \u201cWhat a breath of fresh air from the traffic-blocking trucks with faulty brakes.\u201d With everyone\u2019s phones out, of course the display went viral on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. So who is responsible for this eye-catching set-up? It\u2019s a team of young IT students from Ramnagar including Bonakruthi Vinay, Mylaram Sanjeeva Kiran Kumar, Kongari Rakesh, Kona Shivasai, Bonkuram Veeresh and Surampally who wanted to do something different. Vinay adds that this year, given there were countless conversations in the news about the Internet, the effects of social media, delivery apps and the impact of urban commuting programmes, it felt appropriate to highlight these trending topics which most of us use everyday without a second thought. \u201cWe do something different every year given what is going on in society.\u201dTo top off the fun, the boys also dressed up as trending characters. Vinay dressed up as mask-donning DJ Marshmello who was recently in Hyderabad, and another member Sanju had a PUBG costume.It took them 40 days to plan of which 30 days was physical prep. Any bigger display would have been too much work with their busy schedules. \u201cWe got a lot of appreciation,\u201d Vinay recalls, \u201cmany people said we did excellent work.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Meh Kit\n\u00a0 According to the World Health Organisation, all it takes is 40 seconds of action to start a conversation with someone you think/know is struggling with their mental health. This is the focus of 2019\u2019s World Mental Health Day, which will be observed on October 10. Of late, plenty of action is being taken both online and offline to erase the stigma surrounding such topics. For instance, late last year, Tina Chan, a masters student of Public Health and Health Systems at the University of Waterloo, Canada, came up with the idea of creating a first aid kit for mental trauma. The Panic, Anxiety and Stress Support Kit, or PASS Kit, contains flashcards with concise mental health advice, ear plugs, a foam star, eye mask and chewing gum \u2014 each with a specific purpose (priced at approximately \u20b9800 on mypasskit.com). Starting this year, the college hands them out to all first-year students. Closer home, here are two options for similar kits created by Indian organisations.Bhairavi Prakash, psychologist and founder of Bengaluru-based Mithra Trust, says that a lot of information surrounding depression is focussed on illness and not on well-being. There\u2019s also the lack of knowledge that depression is episodic in nature. So they set about crowdfunding a kit that \u201cgives people information and actions they can engage with\u201d. While they set a target of \u20b92 lakh to create 350 boxes, they raised a little over \u20b93 lakh. One of the main elements is the \u2018What to Say\u2019 card pack. \u201cPeople can say things with good intentions, but it might not make you feel good, and could smack of ignorance. You can hand them one of these cards that suggest how they can reframe their concern,\u201d says Prakash. Some are blank, so you can add your preferred statements. The self-care element includes reminders to reach out to someone, a calender, a journal, a flip book, battery cards to note down people and things that drain and replenish your energy levels, stickers, posters and clay. Available on mithratrust.com, at \u20b9750 each.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA board game from the Science of Happiness kit\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai-based Happiitude \u2014 a company that specialises in training happiness coaches \u2014 also offers this \u201cevidence-based toolkit to help children aged six to 13 take control of their feelings and thoughts\u201d. Founder Karan Behl says, \u201cWe collaborated with researchers from The Berkeley Well-Being Institute and game developers to create modules that use board games with over 200 daily life situations, jigsaw puzzles, journals, posters and worksheets.\u201d It is meant to be used at a school level, and targets mental and emotional well-being, self-image issues and anger management.The price of a kit with training and certification is \u20b928,500; just the kit comes at \u20b915,000.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/meet-indias-spoof-pm/article29416638.ece",
      "\nThe \u2018PM\u2019 and her 17 cabinet ministers do a deep dive into their portfolios to study the real issues faced by the sector, and propose solutions for them in policy notes\n\u00a0 I\u2019m chatting with the Prime Minister on WhatsApp, about everything from cabinet selections to textile policies. If that sounds like a parallel universe, let\u2019s say it almost is. Vidyut Gore is the leader of this Alt Sarkar (government in Hindi), and this exists on Twitter. \u201cIt all started as a joke [in mid August] when someone tweeted \u2018Vidyut for PM\u2019 [in the middle of a conversation about snakes]. So I claimed a \u2018vast surge\u2019 in my popularity and asked people to vote,\u201d she says. After a week-long poll, she won 86% votes out of over 3,000 responses, comfortably beating the incumbent. Even before the poll concluded, people started commenting on the results, suggesting that she announce a cabinet. Things snowballed from there, and by the time the poll ended, \u201cseveral people were already in and preparing acceptance speeches for the swearing in\u201d. Gore put to use @Fek_le and fekle.in \u2014 \u201ca spoof site I\u2019d created and run for a while, but which was more like a blog with occasional posts and nothing in recent years\u201d \u2014 and the government set up was complete. What\u2019s interesting is that the \u2018PM\u2019 and her 17 cabinet ministers \u2014 who come from across the country \u2014 are not just tweeting about what they think the government should be doing. Instead, they do a deep dive into the portfolio to study the real issues faced by the sector, and propose solutions for them in policy notes. These are discussed on Slack (a messaging app similar to WhatsApp), and are put out as Twitter threads. \u201cWe do the things we wish the government did and undo those we wish they didn\u2019t do,\u201d says Gore, adding, \u201cOn a serious note, I think the purpose is to remind people that what we are seeing in the news isn\u2019t really what a government is supposed to do.\u201d It also allows them to play with ideas like legalising the sex industry, for example. This includes the setting up of a temporary Inter-Ministerial Department of Sexual Affairs, and providing shelter, protection and rehabilitation for those who have been forced into prostitution. Alt Minister of Textiles, Kirti Deolekar, suggests a single GST rate of 12% across categories, pricing cotton at international rates and updated labour laws to revive the ailing handloom industry. Scharada Dubey\u2019s Alt Culture Ministry hopes to combat fake news \u201cthat has led to hate, aggression and unhappiness around us\u201d. For those not on the micro-blogging platform, all speeches are available on the site \u2014 and makes for interesting reading. Alt Sarkar has also spawned a whole new sub-section of handles, which are not associated directly with the team \u2014 there is an Alt Opposition, Alt Citizens, Alt Media, Alt NIA, among others. Gore\u2019s guess is that those who did not receive portfolios created their own to engage with this online movement.While Twitter can be an insular echo chamber where we follow and are followed by people who share similar ideals, the team has trolls to thank for going beyond this circle. Gore says, \u201cI think Alt Sarkar broke through to the Right Wing quite a bit. That was the unintended side effect of trying to troll us. They spread our ideas to a new audience, who did not find [our ideas] that bad.\u201d Follow @Fek_le on Twitter and visit fekle.in.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

He says, \u201cThat implies being able to write in multiple fonts.\u201d\u00a0He explains, \u201cI just write in my own handwriting which is rather calligraphic.\u201dGeorgy Roy (@gy_roy)George says \u201cCalligraphy is an art that breaks the typographical structure by adding a natural quality to the designs being shown.\" With three years of experience under his belt, he sticks primarily to hand-lettering which, quite literally, means drawing letters by hand. Avinash Kharat (@avinash_calligraphy)Avinash uploads videos of the technique to his social media audience of over 20,000. The strategy has paid off, bringing in deals with clients like Louis Vuitton and Gucci\u00a0\u201cMy technique has allowed me to stay unique over the decade,\u201d he says."

      "\nGoogle is celebrating the 166th birth anniversary of microbiologist Hans Christian Joachim Gram with a doodle.\n\u00a0 Google is celebrating the 166th birth anniversary of microbiologist Hans Christian Joachim Gram with a doodle in his honour.Gram was born on September 13, 1853, in Denmark\u2019s Copenhagen. Gram is best known for pioneering the method of the Gram stain to identify bacteria.The Danish microbiologist earned an M.D. from the University of Copenhagen in 1878. He then traveled through Europe between 1883 to 1885 studying pharmacology and bacteriology.It was in 1884, while working in the lab of German microbiologist Karl Friedl\u00e4nder in Berlin, that he devised his famous staining technique that is now still used to identify and classify different types of bacteria. He followed the method of Paul Ehrlich, using aniline-water and gentian violet solution.Gram noticed that treating a heat-fixed smear of bacterial cells with a crystal violet stain, followed by an iodine solution and an organic solvent, revealed differences in the structure and biochemical function of various samples.Gram-positive bacteria remained purple because they have a single thick cell wall that is not easily penetrated by the solvent. While, gram-negative bacteria decolorized because they have cell walls with much thinner layers that allow removal of the dye by the solvent.Gram\u2019s discovery not only helps in the identification and classification of bacteria, it also helps decide the treatment of bacterial diseases. For example, the antibiotic penicillin is active only against Gram-positive bacteria. Like the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria will not take up the Gram's stain, it will not take up penicillin either. Pneumococci, which can cause many diseases, are classified as Gram-positive.He published these findings the very same year in a scholarly journal and included a modest dislaimer that his findings are defective and imperfect but he hoped it would turn out to be useful in the hands of future investigators.More than a century later, Gram\u2019s simple staining method, named after its inventor, is still widely used.Gram showed a keen interest in the clinical education of students throughout his career. He retired from his medical practice in 1923 and died at the age of 85 in 1938.The Doodle is illustrated by Danish guest artist Mikkel Sommer who is based between Athens and Berlin.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRepresentation image.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Reuters The ambitious National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) project wants to link social media accounts to the huge database of records related to immigration entry and exit, banking and telephone details among others.The project, initially started in 2009 with a budget of \u20b92,800 crore, is an online database for collating scattered pieces of information and putting them on one platform. At least 10 central agencies like Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and others will have access to the data on a secured platform.The proposal has received resistance from the intelligence agencies, whose officials fear that linking the social media accounts to sensitive government data could expose the system to \u201ctrojan attacks.\u201dHome Minister Amit Shah reviewed the progress of NATGRID at North Block on Thursday.The project gathered pace in 2016, when the NDA government appointed an IB officer Ashok Patnaik as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). After Mr. Patnaik retired, NATGRID is now headed by IAS officer Ashish Gupta.Mr. Shah was given a presentation on the present status of NATGRID but no decision was taken on structural issues.An official explained that NATGRID links intelligence and investigation agencies. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nAadhaar-social media account linkage: Facebook\u2019s concern on privacy a \u2018red herring\u2019, Tamil Nadu govt. tells Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAadhaar-social media account linkage: Facebook\u2019s concern on privacy a \u2018red herring\u2019, Tamil Nadu govt. tells Supreme Court\nThe 10 user agencies will be linked independently with certain databases that would be procured from 21 providing organisations and include telecom, tax records, bank, immigration, etc. to enable the generation of intelligence inputs.\u201cLinking the database to social media accounts could jeopardise the entire exercise as it could be exposed to unknown virus attacks from open source Internet,\u201d a senior government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Intelligence agencies had also earlier opposed the NATGRID itself amid fears that it would impinge on their territory and possibly result in leaks on the leads they were working on to other agencies.An expression of interest (EOI) issued by NATGRID in 2017 had said \u201cNATGRID is intending to set up an Entity Extraction, Visualization and Analytics (EVA) system that would collect and analyse information available from various data sources.\u201dWhile NATGRID\u2019s data recovery centre in Bengaluru has been constructed, its office complex in South Delhi is nearing completion.In January, NATGRID revived its EOI to select a System Integrator (SI) to provide a software solution, recommend hardware specification for running the solution and integrating and implementing the composite EVA solution. The EOI specified that the company bidding for the project should have a turnover of at least \u20b91,600 crore.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gamespot-gears-of-war-gears-5-monster-hunter-world-iceborne/article29399736.ece",
      "The most valuable player (MVP) in Gears 5 goes to Jack the floating robot. He is cool, he is charming and, most of all, extremely helpful in a fight and one of the best additions to the series. The second MVP will always be the legendary Lancer weapon, equipped with a chainsaw bayonet to eviscerate the enemy with ease. Gears 5 Developer: The Coalition Publisher: Xbox Game Studios Price: \u20b93999 for Windows 10 PC and Xbox OneThe Xbox, albeit a worthy console, has not had a decent exclusive in a while. Considering we are not getting a Halo anytime soon, we\u2019ll happily jump at the prospect of a Gears of War game, titled Gears 5.What\u2019s it about?The story picks up after Gears of War 4, which sees our protagonist Kait Diaz go on a path to discover her origins and her connection to the enemy. Around her, the war continues, as the Swarm advances on what\u2019s left of the Coalition forces to wipe them out. In many ways, Gears 5 is a blast from the past, but also paving a way forward for the series. The campaign is exciting and has excellent pacing, but the best part is the refreshing verbal sparring by your teammates that peps things up and helps you bond with them.How does it play?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gears formula has not changed since Gears of War 1 introduced the world to its fantastic cover system. After being used to the ease of The Division\u2019s use of cover, it could initially be a little hard to get into the latest system, but your instincts will soon take over. It is familiar yet new \u2014 including the nifty reload-at-the-right-time-to-get-explosive-ammo mechanic, that is an adrenaline boost when you get the timing right in the middle of a firefight.The game is structured differently this time. Rather than the traditional on-rails levels, the game opens up into an open world environment, much like Metro Exodus.Gears 5 looks incredible, both on the Xbox One X, where it runs 4k at 60 fps, as well as on PC. The game has the same chunky heavy metal look, but the characters display a lot more emotion and a lot of work has gone into crafting the game. The only downside is playing it on the PC, wherein the Windows 10 version 1903 is a requirement. And, it did not go smoothly at all \u2014 it required quite some work to get Gears 5 up and running.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get it?If you are looking for an excellent action game with tons of spectacle and a great story to boot, then Gears 5 is your jam. While it does not reinvent the wheel, it is still a wild ride.It was a successful mission for Capcom in bringing Monster Hunter World outside Japan, with millions of players taking down monsters, to get glory, fame and loot. Now with Iceborne, a downloadable content, Capcom throws down the gauntlet at the players.Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Developer + Publisher: Capcom Price: \u20b93499 for PS4 and Xbox OneWhat is it about?Welcome to Hoarfrost Reach, your new home, as a flurry of migrating monsters has sent you and the Research Commission\u2019s third fleet hot on the heels of a new elder dragon, Velkhana.How does it play?\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of Iceborne as the main boss that stares at you after you complete the entire original game. You have to face a barrage of monsters that are tough to take down, requiring you to go into battles with your team, with a strategy in mind. The reward: more loot to help you create better equipment to help you survive.That said, Hoarfrost Reach is a winter wonderland, with a thriving ecosystem of smaller monsters, and the larger beasts that prey on them. With you at the bottom of that pecking order, Iceborne gives you the Clutch Claw, so you can latch on to the massive monsters like Shadow of the Colossus and hack wildly, giving you a fighting chance against walking nightmares like Banbaro, Betodus or Zinogre.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get it?If you have been into Monster Hunter World, then Iceborne is entering the big leagues. However if you are just starting out, then it is best to get your toes wet trying the base game first.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIn this August 28, 2019, photo, supporters of a measure to limit when companies can label workers as independent contractors rally at the Capitol in Sacramento. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n In a major legislative development that could have a profound impact on the gig economy, California\u2019s State Senate passed, 29 to 11, a Bill requiring ride hailing companies like Uber and Lyft to treat their contract workers as employees.The Bill, which is likely to pass the State Assembly and get the Governor\u2019s signature to become law, will enhance workers\u2019 rights, increase costs for gig economy companies and potentially have knock-on effects in other States.The Bill, known as AB 5, is a consequence of a California Supreme Court 2018 ruling on employee status and could cost Uber and Lyft $3,625 per driver as per a report from Barclays, released in June.Overall, the legislative changes could cost Uber $500 million and Lyft $290 million, by giving their workers paid leave, minimum wages, health benefits, collective bargaining rights and so forth.Uber and Lyft have been opposed to the Bill and had, on August 29, announced a $60 million fund to support a 2020 State ballot measure \u2014 a mechanism that asks eligible voters whether they approve or reject a proposed law.Also read | The \u2018gig\u2019 economy is creating lakhs of jobs, but workers don\u2019t see a futureThe companies\u2019 drivers work as independent contractors and do not get paid medical leave, minimum wage and other benefits that employees are entitled to. Uber and Lyft have said that their ballot measure, would seek to maintain drivers in independent contractor status but give them some protections and rights as regards minimum wage, collective bargaining and health care. DoorDash \u2014 a food delivery company \u2014 said it would contribute $30 million to the fund.The State Assembly will vote on AB 5 later this week. California Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign the Bill as he has already endorsed it.

      "\n\nBlaupunkt\u2019s BTW01 True Wireless HD Sound earbuds : For a high-octane audio experience\n\n",
      "Updated: September 11, 2019 11:27 IST\rPublished: September 11, 2019 11:27 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-btw01-true-wireless-hd-sound-earbuds-blaupunkt-high-octane-audio-experience/article29389855.ece",
      "Buying the right earbuds is a deeply personal experience, like buying the perfect pair of underwear; it has to fit and feel good, all while speaking of the wearer\u2019s personality. Invest in the wrong pair and it looks, feels and sounds just oh-so-wrong. Now earbuds, too, have branched out in terms of various sensitivites, builds, lifestyle choices and design elements. That said, when Blaupunkt\u2019s BTW01 True Wireless HD Sound earbuds arrived at my doorstep, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect... but leave it to the Germans to engineer something special at a pocket-friendly price tag of \u20b97,999 (\u20b94,999 on Amazon India).The unboxing experience is simple, without too much paper waste, which is such a conscientious win. The only accessories are the switchable ear-cups for comfort and a short micro-USB cable. I haven\u2019t touched that or removed the twist-ties seeing as a single household would definitely have those lying around already. The ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic build material is a practical choice for its low weight and scratch-resistant durability, perfect for people like myself who have a haphazardly-filled handbag. Each earbud weighs 5.5 grams with a 6-millimetre speaker, but that won\u2019t affect sound quality.SpecificationsInline Remote: YesConnectivity: BluetoothMagnet Type: NeodymiumHeadphone Driver Units: 6Voice Assistants: Siri, Google AssistantBattery: Each earbud with 75mAh battery lasting 6 hoursCharging dock: 590mAh, 24hrs extra talktimeEach earbud is equipped with a 75mAh battery lasting up to six hours, which is superior for something this affordable. I\u2019ve used the BTW01s everyday for a month now and setting them back in the charging dock has kept them up and running. But here\u2019s the real whipper-snapper: not once, have I found the need to recharge the 590mAh charging dock. The auto-off timer is a saviour, too for the moments you get too comfortable and forget you\u2019re wearing them at all... yes, I did that on a couple of occasions.Audio on the BTW01s is a rainbow ride, purely because there is no compromise on sound. BTW01\u2019s pairing is wickedly intuitive, compared to some other brand names and models which often bring up \u2018pairing unsuccessful\u2019 or \u2018out of range\u2019 error messages which do mar the whole she-bang. The noise-cancellation isn\u2019t dizzying either \u2014 a thoughtful move on Blaupunkt\u2019s part \u2014 allowing for only the slightest environmental noise, which means yoga and meditation sessions are a breeze. No resonance in these earbuds, thanks to the slightly-angled acoustic tunnels. Adjusting volume by the increments is simple, with the touch-pads on the enclosed backs of the earbuds. The bass isn\u2019t overtly punchy or thick, and the treble doesn\u2019t sound scratchy. Audiophiles, don\u2019t expect these earbuds to come with a companion app though, so that knocks out the prospect of customising sound profiles or adjusting presets. Taking and making calls on the BTW01s is uncomplicated, but the volume jump between, say, watching a YouTube video to taking call is a little jarring, so be prepared to start lowering the volume as a call comes in or switch to your handset.The BTW01s\u2019 purpose goes beyond casual listening; Blaupunkt\u2019s made a good break into the Indian market when overpriced and under-performing earbuds are overhyped... they are proof that you don\u2019t need to break the bank to make a set of high-performance earbuds.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSumbul Desai, Managing Director, Apple's vice-president of Health, speaks at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California on September 10, 2019.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Reuters  Apple Inc caught up with hardware rivals on Tuesday by revealing a triple-camera iPhone, and it rolled out a streaming TV service priced at $5 a month, undercutting Disney and Netflix.The announcements came at the company\u2019s biggest marketing event, where it unveils its top products for the year ahead, and showcased an aggressive Apple ready to battle on price.The long-awaited Apple TV+ streaming television service will be available in over 100 countries, starting in November. The service will not be available in China when it launches, nor will the Apple Arcade video game subscription.Buyers of an iPhone, iPad or Mac will get a free year of streaming TV, potentially drawing hundreds of millions of viewers to the service. That catapults the new service into a rarified group of companies.\u201cI think the pricing on the Apple TV service was definitely a positive surprise,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the hammering in some of the other video service-related names like Netflix, Amazon and Roku. Clearly, that was a positive that people were happy to hear.\u201dThere was no bundle with Apple Music or other services as some analysts had expected. But Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the TV service, a $5 a month \u201cArcade\u201d gaming service and the base model iPhone 11, seem designed to draw in users for the longer term.\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting Apple Arcade and particularly Apple TV to be priced as aggressively as they were,\u201d Bajarin said. \u201cThey know once consumers get into their ecosystem, they don\u2019t leave.\u201dApple said its new iPhone 11 will come with two back cameras, including an ultra wide-angle lens and the next generation of microchips, the A13. Prices start at $699 (\u20b964,900), down from last year\u2019s new iPhone that started at $749.The more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back \u2014 wide angle, telephoto and ultra-wide. It can create videos with all three back cameras and the front camera at the same time and starts at $999 (\u20b999,900). The iPhone 11 Pro Max with a bigger screen starts at $1,099 (\u20b9109,900). The new phones are available to order Friday and will start shipping Sept. 20.Rivals including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. already sell phones with three cameras on the back. While Apple once tested the upper limits of what consumers would pay for a phone, it is now giving ground on prices, even making older models available at significant discounts to the latest technology.\u201cConsumers absolutely still care about cameras. That\u2019s why it was surprising over the last couple of years that Samsung and Huawei got the jump on Apple,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cApple was playing a bit of catch up, but Apple did bring their game, particularly on the video side of the camera, where I do think they\u2019ll have the leg up.\u201dAnalysts expect Apple will sell around 200 million iPhones in the next year, in addition to other devices, and while many of those will be in China, it ensures at least tens of millions of potential viewers for the subscription service.Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple\u2019s lower priced iPhones \u201caren\u2019t exciting on the surface, but the low streaming price may suck in some new subscribers.\u201d Apple shares gained 0.8%.With streaming content, Apple is entering a crowded field dominated by Netflix Inc.Walt Disney Co. will launch on Nov. 12 a $7-per-month service that will contain that firm\u2019s iconic children\u2019s content. Apple is also trying to beat HBO Max with its hit shows like Game of Thrones, Friends and The Sopranos.Apple\u2019s challenge is to persuade consumers that its family of devices, from its set-top box to phones, are the best one-stop place to watch shows.The roll-out of new subscription-based services by Apple paves the way for the introduction of new business models akin to the all-you-can-eat bundles like Amazon Prime,\u201d said Paolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight. \u201cIn the future we might even see users pay for a service bundle and receive a new iPhone every year.Apple also unveiled an updated watch, the Series 5, with an always-on display, starting at $399 (\u20b940,900), while keeping the older Series 3 starting at $199. Moorhead said the older model would drive \u201ctremendous\u201d business.Apple said the seventh generation of the iPad will start at $329 and be available to order starting Tuesday and in stores on Sept. 30.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThis Sept. 12, 2018, file photo shows an Apple iPhone XR on display at the Steve Jobs Theater.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Apple is expected to unveil three new iPhone models that are so similar to last year\u2019s lineup, they may be upstaged by details about the company\u2019s upcoming video service. The company will show off its latest iPhones on Tuesday at an annual hardware showcase. But the buzz surrounding its best-selling products has waned, as have sales, in the absence of compelling new features.IPhone shipments are down 25% so far this year, according to the research firm IDC, putting more pressure on Apple to generate revenue from services such as music streaming, product repairs, revenue sharing from apps and ad commissions from making Google the default search engine. Revenue from services rose 14% to nearly $23 billion during the first half of this year. And now Apple is getting ready to roll out a Netflix-like video service that will feature a slate of original programs featuring stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Jason Momoa. Apple provided a peek in March, but hasn\u2019t specified when it will debut this fall or how much it will cost. Those details are expected to be revealed Tuesday, along with more information about a video gaming service called Arcade. The company\u2019s new phone models will likely mirror last year\u2019s iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max. Prices are likely to stay at $750 to $1,100, before add-ons such as more storage. And they will likely have the same design \u2014 with more display space, less bezel and no home button \u2014 that Apple switched to with the iPhone X in 2017. With little change, many customers who bought models in the past two years may hold off upgrading this year, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights said. The biggest difference is likely to be in the phone\u2019s camera, an area that Apple and its rivals have all been trying to improve as consumers snap more pictures on their devices. Even there, improvements from year to year have been small. This year, Apple is expected to add an extra camera lens to each model. The two pricier models already have a telephoto lens for better zoom. Now, they are expected to sport a wide-angle lens to capture more of a scene than regular shots. The cheapest model is expected to get one of those features, but it\u2019s not clear which. Even with those additions, the new iPhones may still be catching up with the improvements that rivals such as Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo and Google have been making to their latest phones. Unlike some of the other devices coming out this year, the new iPhones aren\u2019t expected to support upcoming ultrafast cellular networks known as 5G. Apple paid billions of dollars to settle a royalty dispute with chipmaker Qualcomm in April to gain the technology it needs for 5G iPhones, but those models aren\u2019t expected to be ready until next year. Besides iPhones, Apple is also expected to provide looks at the next versions of its internet-connected watch and its video-streaming device, Apple TV. New iPads could also be in the mix.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\nThe Big Tech giants that were once praised as engines of economic growth with massive efficiencies have increasingly come under fire for allegedly misusing their clout in the market and lapses such as privacy breaches. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP  Attorneys-General of 50 U.S. States and territories announced on Monday that they were launching an investigation into Google\u2019s trade practices and whether they are threatening competition and harming consumers.\u201cThis is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet,\u201d Texas AG Ken Paxton, who is leading the coalition, said on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, here in Washington DC, on Monday. He also made it clear that at present this was an investigation and not a lawsuit.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition,\u201d Mr. Paxton said, adding that there is evidence that Google\u2019s business practices stifled competition, violated users\u2019 privacy , \u201c put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information\u201d and undermined consumer choice.Louisiana Attorney General, who was also present at the Court on Monday, said there was an \u201cabsolutely existential threat in our virtual marketplace\u201d. Alabama and California \u2013 the home of Google - have not joined the investigation, while Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have joined 48 states in the investigating coalition.Regulators have turned up the heat on big technology companies and the Google probe is but the latest sign of this. New York will lead a group of eight States and the District of Columbia in investing whether Facebook \u201cstifled competition and put users at risk\u201d, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced last Friday. The big four \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 are being scrutinised or subject to probes already between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the U.S.\u2019 trade regulator, and the Department of Justice (DoJ).The DOJ announced in late July that it is launching an investigation into \u201cwhether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power\u201d and have engaged in conduct that has stifled innovation.\u00a0You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nRobots dominating job market is not inevitable: Oxford economist Carl Frey\n\n",
      "Updated: September 9, 2019 19:45 IST\rPublished: September 9, 2019 19:45 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/robots-dominating-job-market-is-not-inevitable-oxford-economist-carl-frey/article29375661.ece",
      "A research published six years ago by two Oxford academics, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, seemed to reinforce this ominous prediction about the global economy: Robots are going to take over our jobs. For, it warned that \u201cabout 47% of total US employment is at risk\u201d due to computerisation. Carl, this year, expanded the ideas of the research in a book, which is portentously titled, The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor, and Power in the Age of Automation. Contrary to what it seems, Carl, a genial Swedish-German economic historian, is neither a doomsday prophesier of technology nor a closet Luddite. He appreciates the long-term benefits of automation, and acknowledges the help of algorithms in his research. He says that the 47% from the research paper is misunderstood by many. For, he explains, the paper merely examines the possibility of automation and doesn\u2019t guarantee its outcome.MetroPlus met the economist during his visit to Bengaluru last week to discuss the rise of the robots, future job markets, among other things.Excerpts:Can automation \u2014 and the resultant loss of jobs \u2014 lead to social upheaval in a developing economy like India, which already has a large section of the population unemployed?If you look at the industrial revolution in Britain, for example, industrialisation caused a social upheaval, right? People petitioned the Parliament to block the introduction of new technologies, and they clashed with the British Army on several occasions. But I think the problem in India is that the manufacturing sector has failed to modernise. So it\u2019s become uncompetitive, which is even worse than having robots taking over jobs, because it means that instead of having some part of production being automated, you are essentially losing all of it. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why automation was allowed to progress in the United States. The labour unions understood that if production isn\u2019t automated, it may move abroad.How should governments of the present and the future prepare to deal with disruptions due to automation?I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single policy that can solve the situation. One part is managing the transition from the rural countryside to big cities. One thing we know about these new industries is that they tend to be highly clustered in cities like Bengaluru. And I think that process is only going to continue, and there\u2019s a sense that the countryside is being left behind. So, I think that you need to invest a lot in education and schooling, to make sure that people in the countryside have an opportunity to take on jobs that are emerging in the cities. You may have to incentivise people to actually move to the cities and help them financially in relocation. You need to invest a lot in public infrastructure and make sure that people can feasibly commute to work from the countryside. There also needs to be some form of reliable social security for people that are left behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nGP Sampath Kumar\n \n\n\n\n\nAn opinion poll by the Pew Research Center survey in 2017 found that 85% of US respondents favoured policies to restrict the rise of the robots. But do you think their rise is inevitable?No, I don\u2019t think so and history proves that. For millennia, growth was slow and stagnant because most people resisted technological change. There\u2019s always been a lot of groups that don\u2019t have an interest in new technologies being adopted \u2014 that can sometimes be workers and even the governments themselves. For example, one of the reasons you don\u2019t have any railroads in Argentina is because the lorry union there is extremely strong, and they wouldn\u2019t benefit from the railroads.What are some of the major jobs that could become redundant?There are very few industries that are unexposed to automation. But the main industries that we think are very likely to see significant job displacement are transportation, logistics, loaded duty autonomous vehicles, and warehouses. And production is going to continue to be more automated. And we\u2019re also seeing it quite significantly in the retail sector.So, what kind of jobs will today\u2019s children be doing in the next 25 years or so?We need to be humble about predicting the job market of the future. If you go back to the 1900s and ask someone, \u2018What do you think your grandchildren are going to be?\u2019, they wouldn\u2019t have said software engineers or hot yoga instructors or travel agents. I think jobs involving creative skills and complex social interactions are going to be increasingly important. Also, it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9 now: data is going to be the new oil. So, if you want to work with new technologies, then knowing stats and machine learning will be helpful.Can you also mention some of the new jobs that will be created due to automation?We are already seeing some new jobs emerging, like big data architects, cloud service specialists, Android developers and more. There are jobs like Zumba instructors, beachbody coaches. Also, some jobs that have existed for a while \u2014 like sommeliers \u2014 are back in vogue now. Because as we grow richer, we demand more services.Is your job safe from automation?High risk (Above 90%): Telemarketers, data entry keyers, tellers, sports referees, tour guides and moreMedium risk (45-55%): Dental assistants, medical appliance technicians, commercial pilots, massage therapists, fire inspectors and moreLow risk (Below 10%): Mental health counsellors, physicians and surgeons, preschool teachers, anthropologists and archaeologists and more(Source: The Future of Employment, 2013)What kind of political changes do you expect to happen around the globe?In western economies, if you go back to the 60s and 70s, you see that high-income voters tend to vote for the right and low-income, working-class voters tend to vote for the left. In the beginning of the 80s, you see a shift, wherein the highly educated voters tend to opt for the political left, whereas high-income voters continue to support the right. And, that has left the working class politically disenfranchised. And, that is the anger that the populists are tapping into effectively. I think the political outcomes over the next few years, or even decades, will depend on whether the liberal parties can provide credible solutions for the challenges posed by automation.Can you mention some of the key positives that can result out of this automation surge?If you look at history, it has been overwhelmingly positive in terms of technological progress. If you look at Britain, for example, people don\u2019t work in coal mines, where they don\u2019t see daylight for weeks and explosions are part of everyday life. Most people now work in air-conditioned offices. We have an abundance of goods and services that were unimaginable 200 years ago, right? So, technology over the long run is an extremely positive thing, but it can create short-term disruptions. In an economy like India, you need to make sure that people have the feeling that they have some stake in long-term growth.Do you think technology can help the environmental issues we are facing now?Yes, technology can be a part of the solution. It\u2019s true that new industries are less carbon-intensive than the smokestack industries of the past. Dematerialisation has certainly been a plus to the environment. We need to shift towards renewable energy. We may even need to think about geo-engineering. You\u2019d said in an interview that our debates on technology haven\u2019t progressed much since the early 18th century. So, what are the questions we should be asking?I think it\u2019s more about asking if technological progress is welfare-improving or not? It makes society richer, but does it make everybody better off? If significant groups in the labour market lose out, they can potentially opt against it. Therefore, we need policies in place to manage the short-term effects. And, there\u2019s always been this very polarised debate where it\u2019s either \u2018technology is wonderful; it\u2019s the solution to everything\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s dystopia\u2019. I think we need to see technology for what it is: which is, it\u2019s a good thing, but not necessarily good for everyone in the short run.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: An efficient, surprisingly light phone that\u2019s burdened by its price\n\n",
      "Updated: September 9, 2019 19:25 IST\rPublished: September 9, 2019 19:25 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-an-efficient-surprisingly-light-phone-thats-burdened-by-its-price/article29375536.ece",
      "Not on many occasions, I suppose, does a smartphone aid in self-reflection. In this regard, the Aura Glow version of Samsung Note 10+ is somewhat a historical device. A few moments after unboxing it, I was staring at my reflection while checking its back, which bears a striking resemblance to the shiny surface of the late compact disc. You will get the design if you are a fan of flamboyance in fashion. If you aren\u2019t one, like me, you will just ask, to no one in particular, \u2018why?\u2019If you overlook the garish back, a few other annoyances (like the deprivation of the 3.5mm earphone jack) and the hefty price tag (costs \u20b979,999), the Note 10+ is an efficient, easy-to-carry smartphone (weighs 196 grams).With the Aura Glow version of the Note 10+, the first thing that would catch your attention is its look \u2014 whether you like it or not is a different matter. The front of it is sleek and smooth with a notch-less, almost bezel-less Dynamic AMOLED display \u2014 the front camera, like a bindi, is placed in the centre. The front and rear glass panels and the phone\u2019s metal coalesce into one shimmering device that feels slick when held.The back is where the problem is. Well, the bling, of course, is a matter of taste. But even if you like the reflective surface, it will soon be smeared by fingerprints \u2014 which can easily mar the experience. \u2018Will I protect the phone from staining by covering it (and, thereby, diminishing its original beauty) or let it remain uncovered (and oversee the finger-smudges)?\u2019 is a question that requires some contemplation.The Cinematic Infinity Display can achieve peak brightness of up to 1200 nits \u2014 even under a sunny noon sky, I could read a news article with ease. The images, whilst watching a video, appear rich as well. With AKG\u2019s stereo speakers accentuated by Dolby Atmos, binging on TV shows is fun (the earphones that came with the device kept coming off my ears though). SpecificationsDISPLAY: 6.8-inch Quad HD+, Dynamic AMOLED Infinity-O Display, 3040\u00d71440 (498ppi), HDR10+ CertifiedCAMERAS: REAR: Quad Camera, Ultra Wide: 16MP F2.2 (123\u00b0), Wide-angle: 12MP 2PD AF F1.5/F2.4 OIS (77\u00b0), Telephoto: 12MP F2.1 OIS (45\u00b0), DepthVision Camera: VGA; FRONT: 10MP 2PD AF F2.2 (80\u00b0)BODY: 77.2 x 162.3 x 7.9mm, 196g, (BLE S Pen: 5.8 \u00d7 4.35 \u00d7 105.08 3.04g)BATTERY: 4,300mAh; Super Fast Charging compatible on wired with QC2.0, AFC and PD3.0; Wireless charging speeds with Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 compatible with WPC and PMAAUTHENTICATION: Lock Type: Pattern, PIN, Password; Biometric Lock Types: Fingerprint sensor, Face recognitionThe S-Pen, perhaps the most distinct accessory that comes with the Note series, is slightly more than just a gimmicky stylus this time. It is stubbier than its predecessors, which makes it easier to hold. The note-taking and doodling apart, it is helpful in clicking selfies, adjusting volume, navigating through gallery, among other things.Of course, these are mundane functions, but in order to perform them with the S-Pen, you need to make swishes and flicks much like what the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry do with their magic wands. But these movements aren\u2019t easy to master \u2014 you\u2019d rather use your fingers to change the camera mode than use the S-Pen and end up producing 10 weird selfies.Samsung has also improved its DeX feature that lets you use its Android apps on your computer screens with the help of just a USB Type-C to HDMI cable. To do the same in the Galaxy S8 version, you need a DeX station that costs over \u20b98,000. DeX is handy but far from completion, as many apps don\u2019t support this feature.When it comes to the Note10+ camera, there isn\u2019t a drastic change from Galaxy S10. And, that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it is already among the best smartphone cameras. The triple camera set-up (16MP ultrawide+12MP wide-angle+12MP telephoto) with DepthVision is adequate even for a serious photographer. There is a host of camera modes \u2014 hyperlapse, super slow mo, night, food and more \u2014 that makes it easy even for novices to click and record decent photos and videos. The live video mode, for instance, blurs the background of the subject, creating a bokeh effect \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work all the time, but when used right, produces cool outcomes.The AR Doodles and emojis allow you to fiddle around if you want to indulge in drawing moustaches or make funny faces. The doodles on the face will follow the face as it moves, even while recording videos. You can also record yourself doodling, if you press the record button before you begin to draw.For its weight, the Note 10+ packs a big battery \u2014 in fact the 4,300mAh cell is more powerful than its younger sibling the Note 10, and is the most resilient in the Note series. If you aren\u2019t into constant heavy-duty gaming, the phone will easily last over a day after a charge. And, of course, if you want to quickly do your hair, you can always turn your phone around to use it as a makeshift mini-mirror.The Note 10+ could have topped my list of the best smartphone releases this year but it loses out by a small margin to the smoother, sleeker and significantly more inexpensive OnePlus 7 Pro.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nGoogle fined for sharing data on children \n",
      "Updated: September 6, 2019 22:08 IST\rPublished: September 6, 2019 22:05 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-fined-for-sharing-data-on-children/article29354798.ece",
      "Google, which owns YouTube video service, will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children\u2019s channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to deliver million of dollars in targeted advertisements to those viewers.The settlement with the FTC and the New York attorney general's office, which will receive $34 million, is the largest since a law banning collecting information about children under age 13 came into effect in 1998. The law was revised in 2013 to include \u201ccookies,\u201d used to track a person's internet viewing habits.It is also small compared with the company's revenues. Alphabet, which generates about 85% of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, in July reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion.YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that in four months it would begin treating all data collected from people watching children's content as if it came from a child. \u201cThis means that we will limit data collection and use on videos made for kids only to what is needed to support the operation of the service,\u201d YouTube said on its blog.In late August, YouTube announced it would launch YouTube Kids with separate niches for children depending on their ages and designed to exclude disturbing videos. It has no behavioral advertising.YouTube allows companies to create channels, which include advertisements that create revenue for both the company and YouTube.In its complaint, the government said that YouTube touted its popularity with children in marketing itself to companies like Mattel and Hasbro. It told Mattel that \u201cYouTube is todays leader in reaching children age 6-11 against top TV channels,\u201d according to the complaint.\u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. \u201dYet when it came to complying with (federal law banning collecting data on children), the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids.\u201dNew York Attorney General Letitia James said the companies \u201dabused their power.\u201d\u201cGoogle and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,\u201d said James.In addition to the monetary fine, the proposed settlement requires the company to refrain from violating the law in the future and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children.The two Democrats on the FTC, Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, dissented from the settlement. Slaughter, who called the violations \u201cwidespread and brazen,\u201d said the settlement fails to require YouTube to police channels that provide children's content but do not designate it as such, thus allowing more lucrative behavioral advertising, which relies on tracking viewers through cookies. Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats active in online privacy matters, criticised the settlement in separate statements.\u201cA financial settlement is no substitute for strict reforms that will stop Google and other tech companies from invading our privacy,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cI continue to be alarmed by Big Techs policies and practices that invade children's lives.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nDesi for dinner at the Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen with Priya Krishna \n",
      "Updated: September 6, 2019 18:58 IST\rPublished: September 6, 2019 18:58 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/desi-for-dinner-at-the-bon-apptit-test-kitchen-with-priya-krishna/article29353167.ece",
      "\n(Clockwise from bottom left) Aloo gobi; the cover of Indian-ish; PRiya with mother Ritu Krishna; and saag feta \u00a0 \u201cIn the Krishna family, we do things our own way,\u201d Priya Krishna tells the cameraman as she FaceTimes her father in the middle of a video shoot. Today\u2019s recipe is roti pizza. And once it\u2019s done, the rest of the team at Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s Test Kitchen will gladly dig in: after all, they\u2019re privy to many recipes from her cookbook, Indian-Ish. The food and entertaining site entered YouTube in 2012, starting with the traditional \u2018hands-and-pans\u2019 tutorials that are now a Buzzfeed Tasty signature. Four years down the line, they debuted their first series, It\u2019s Alive, with crowd favourite Brad Leone demonstrating recipes with microbial food cultures. This was followed by Gourmet Makes in 2017, where contributor Claire Saffitz attempts to make elevated versions of popular junk foods like Snickers, jelly beans and Doritos. Through these videos, they have developed a cult following, of which Priya is now getting a taste.With eight of her recipes now featured on the site\u2019s YouTube channel, the numbers are testament to her popularity \u2014 the videos have amassed over 3.9 million views overall. She has been taken aback by the way people have embraced these recipes, often tagging her in their recreations of saag feta, or the ubiquitous aloo gobi. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel real that so many people tune in to watch. I always think to myself, \u2018Aren\u2019t these videos... boring? What makes them exciting?\u2019 So to see people get jazzed about me making my mom\u2019s dahi toast on camera is extremely cool,\u201d says Priya. It is heartening for her because when she walked into the Bon App\u00e9tit offices three years ago, there was a marked lack of Indian food representation. She started by writing guides \u2014 on chaat, condiments and egg dosas. Soon enough, she was bringing her cuisine to the Test Kitchen. \u201cBrad has the same laid back approach to cooking as I do. We both try to lean into the fact that we are not professionals \u2014 and that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m a home cook, and I think that\u2019s what helps me stand out. That, and the fact that the test kitchen remains a pretty white space,\u201d she says, referring to the fact that she is the only Indian on the Test Kitchen\u2019s list of staff and contributors, while Mexican and South East Asian heritages are represented.Her mother, Ritu, who co-wrote the cookbook, is a major inspiration for Priya to keep cooking Indian. \u201cShe had to use feta because she couldn\u2019t find paneer for saag paneer. That\u2019s authentic to me, and to my experience,\u201d she says. The book, which was published in April this year, plays up its Indian-ness. There\u2019s artwork by Maria Qamar (@hatecopy on Instagram), whose desi pop style depicts the experiences of first generation Indians living in the west. And author-TV host Padma Lakshmi\u2019s foreword talks about growing up with immigrant parents who kept their heritage alive: in the process, they created a new cuisine that \u201callows for wacky things like using olive oil... making pizzas with roti, and baking eggless cakes\u201d. However, Priya says there\u2019s more to be done than sharing videos and writing books. \u201cI still encounter editors who will willingly publish an Italian soup recipe with 15 ingredients but not a dal recipe with four. All of us that represent Indian cuisine are fighting to make it a part of mainstream home-cooking conversations,\u201d she emphasises. So what\u2019s the endgame for this crusade? \u201cHonestly, I just want people to be making dal chawal for Tuesday night dinner.\u201dIndian-Ish is available on Amazon.in at \u20b91,700You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe online popularity made tweeting addictive for Javerbaum. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stop\u2026 The likes and the re-tweets going up and up, and it gets your pheromones going,\u201d he says. \u00a0 God has six million followers on Twitter. But he follows only one account: Justin Bieber. What\u2019s so special about the pop singer? \u201cFrom what God told me, he only follows close family members. That\u2019s all I could get out of him,\u201d answers David Javerbaum, who runs the hugely popular @TheTweetOfGod account. While the snarky content is mostly aimed at American politics, climate change deniers and the general state of the world, a recent tweet brought up India. \u201cJust so you don\u2019t think I\u2019m totally obsessed with America, #RIPSushmaSwaraj.

Check out this article about Me in The Hindu. A big \u0927\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u0926 to @Namrata_Joshi for writing it and the Trim\u016brti for donating the column space. https://t.co/j3Wji9BITqIt got me wondering about God\u2019s social media manager, and a few DMs (direct messages) later, I got a response. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot,\u201d said God, claiming that though he himself is a genius, his earthly secretary was a \u201cno-good drivelling moron\u201d. Speaking from Los Angeles a week after this exchange, Javerbaum keeps up with the act that he isn\u2019t God, but merely works with/for him. I play along.Everyone knows how God created man, but what is the tale behind the genesis of his Twitter account? \u201cHe said \u2018I want to communicate with people and need someone funny to help punch up my jokes\u2019. He knew I was one of his chosen people, which helped,\u201d explains Javerbaum. Back in 2010, they began working on a book \u2014 The Last Testament: A Memoir by God. \u201cWorking with God, it was easy to get a publishing deal with Simon and Schuster,\u201d he says. His editor pointed him to Twitter, which was just gaining popularity, and the account caught on. \u201cI guess God and I were pretty good at it,\u201d he looks back. \n\nTHE FIVE STAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE1. Denial2. Guilt3. Depression4. Acceptance5. Drowning\u2014 God (@TheTweetOfGod) August 19, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0THE FIVE STAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE1. Denial2. Guilt3. Depression4. Acceptance5. Drowning\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the book eventually came out in 2011, people thought it was derivative of the Twitter account, though it wasn\u2019t quite so. Nevertheless, Javerbaum is very proud of it: \u201cIt\u2019s God looking back at the Bible and the New Testament and a lot of other aspects of human life. I would take a little less Twitter popularity for a little more book sales!\u201d Meanwhile, the online popularity made tweeting addictive for him. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stop\u2026 The likes and the re-tweets going up and up, and it gets your pheromones going,\u201d he says.A few years later, he was approached by a Broadway producer about turning the account into a stage play. The Act of God played on Broadway for two consecutive summers, and went all over the world. It is yet to be performed in India, and he would love for that to happen some day soon. He is also on the verge of expanding into two other areas of entertainment. \u201cI may have a couple of cool things to announce soon,\u201d he says. \n\nAt those darkest moments when it feels like I've abandoned you, remember: I was never with you to begin with.\u2014 God (@TheTweetOfGod) July 13, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0At those darkest moments when it feels like I've abandoned you, remember: I was never with you to begin with.God tweets and sometimes re-tweets others with comments, but doesn\u2019t engage so much in arguments, discussions, conversations. Can followers elicit a quick-witted reaction? \u201cGod replies to tweets exactly as often as he replies to prayers from other people,\u201d comes another quick response.Javerbaum lets us in on the secret that through this Twitter account, God is desperate to get into the Indian market \u2014 \u201cthe 33 crore gods are calling to him.\u201d What explains this knowledge of our politics, personalities and celebrities? \u201cIt\u2019s the largest market other than China. But China has no Twitter, and even God doesn\u2019t understand Chinese,\u201d says Javerbaum, who is yet to visit the subcontinent. \n\nI send natural disasters to punish mankind for being stupid enough to believe in a God who would send natural disasters to punish it.\u2014 God (@TheTweetOfGod) July 9, 2019 \n\n\n\u00a0I send natural disasters to punish mankind for being stupid enough to believe in a God who would send natural disasters to punish it.There has been a flip side to the success. Five years ago, the account was hacked, after which Javerbaum quit for a year and a half. Many have been offended, but \u201cnot as many as [I] would have wanted\u201d. Twitter itself has suspended his account twice. First, for a tweet that was mistakenly thought of as anti-gay, whereas it was anything but. Second was with a genuine reason: the background picture in his account had a blue tick despite his own account remaining resolutely unverified. \u201cIt\u2019s a Twitter trademark that can\u2019t be used without permission.\u201d Even by God, who supposedly should need no validation.Ask why there is an irreverent, at times cynical, view of the government, religion, institutions and also climate change, and he counters, \u201cI won\u2019t say \u2018at times\u2019. It\u2019s always cynical.\u201d Do Donald Trump in the US and many of his ilk provide him ample material? \u201cThe only time there would be no material for satire will be in a perfect world. And I don\u2019t see that coming any time soon. I do think that if it were a perfect world, my [in]ability to make fun of it would be a small price to pay,\u201d he says.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nYour story Attract the right audience and reaction.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nMykyta Dolmatov\n Razia Khatoon, 24, used to be a national-level archer, and has an M.Sc in Physics. In 2016, just for a lark, she posted a few videos of dishes she had cooked. Today, Cook with Razia has over 5 lakh followers on YouTube and over 5.4 lakh followers on TikTok.\u201cI had never entered a kitchen,\u201d she says in Hindi over the phone. \u201cThere was a function at home, and my dadi helped me make rasmalai,\u201d she says. \u201cI got so much praise that I decided to put it online.\u201d Khatoon\u2019s content is in Hindi and has a certain honesty \u2014 there\u2019s no posturing or foreign locales. She gets comments from around the world. And using this platform, Khatoon has expanded her business model to include cooking classes and making baked goods on order. She collaborates with brands such as Snapdeal, Infinix mobile and Meesho.\n\n\n\n\n\nRazia Khatoon \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media influencers or SMIs like Khatoon are plenty, but the interesting thing is that Khatoon lives in Jamshedpur. And engineering diploma holder Mohit Sukhija, 22, lives in Bathinda.While looking for a job, Sukhija began to post his mother\u2019s embroidery on ShareChat, where he now has 20,000 followers. Using social media to help his mother\u2019s business grow became his best idea yet. Today, the family gets orders from as far as the U.S.According to Shubho Sengupta, Delhi-based digital marketing specialist, content is heading out of the cities. \u201cLook at the Skill India account on TikTok,\u201d says Sengupta. The most popular videos are of the underdog achieving greatness: for instance, welder Sachin Narale who went from a poor family in Soradi, Maharashtra, to the international stage; or Rohim Momin, a bricklayer from Khaltipur, Bengal, who won international awards. ShareChat, in fact, is not available in English at all, but has 15 Indian languages to choose from.Younger the betterNot only are SMIs now emerging from small-town India, but they are also getting younger by the day. All of 24, Sejal Kumar has 1.1 million YouTube subscribers and over six lakh followers on Instagram. When I call her, she first wants to know what the story is about, how long it will be, and whether her picture will be used. To the pre-social-media generation, this might sound narcissistic, but for Kumar, it\u2019s just business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSejal Kumar \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fashion and lifestyle SMI juggles time ideating, creating content, talking to fans, and negotiating with brands. She employs a team of four, and recently moved from Delhi to Mumbai. \u201cWe\u2019re the new-age stars,\u201d she says, seeing herself on a par with Bollywood celebrities a few years on. Sure enough, the economics graduate won 2019 Instagrammer of the Year (for fashion) along with Priyanka Chopra and Virat Kohli.These 20-something SMIs are bagging the biggest brands, ranging from Pizza Hut and Dairy Milk to BMW and Myntra. For Shivesh Bhatia, 23, with 1.8 lakh followers on Instagram, or Ranveer Allahbadia, 26, with 2.2 million followers on YouTube, their very first profession has been that of \u2018influencer\u2019. They are unfazed by social media\u2019s rapidly evolving landscape \u2014 from blogs to Facebook to YouTube to Instagram to TikTok and ShareChat. SMIs keep up, simply shrinking the size of their content accordingly.Faisal Khan, 31, who has over 7 lakh subscribers on his YouTube channel MotorBeam, and has worked with Apollo Tyres, Tommy Hilfiger, ICICI Bank, OnePlus, and more, gives the example of a 15-second video he shot for TikTok that had him opening the door of a Volvo and sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, followed by a shot of the car refrigerator and a couple of champagne flutes. \u201cIt has crossed 5.5 million views,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaisal Khan \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion makersThis cocky young breed is replacing traditional marketing channels to an extent where phone brand Oppo India\u2019s vice-president of product and marketing, Sumit Walia, calls them \u2018key opinion leaders\u2019. In fact, when Jo Malone, a U.K.-based luxury brand, invited people for a meet and greet in the capital, the smattering of traditional journalists had to wait for over an hour-and-a-half because the all-important SMIs had not arrived.Just as cheap smartphones and Jio\u2019s launch in 2016 created a generation of WhatsApp university graduates, it has also created a kind of young influencer who bargains for freebies, turns up late, and is often clueless about the products they work with.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkanksha Redhu \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Saumyaa Vohra, lifestyle editor at GQ, says, only a few have knowledge and experience. \u201cIf they have a fashion vlog, it only works if they have studied fashion or worked in a fashion magazine for some years. It\u2019s not just about putting up pretty pics and chasing likes and followers.\u201d Many new young SMIs, she says, \u201care exhausting\u201d. Manjira Dutta, co-founder of Don\u2019t Be Content, a content company, agrees. \u201cBarring a few, most of them don\u2019t understand much,\u201d says Dutta. \u201cWe write the copy, we check the copy, and we tell them how and when to post.\u201dMonetising viewsNone of which is impacting the SMI\u2019s earnings. A single Instagram post could fetch up to \u20b91.2 lakh, while a YouTube video earns up to \u20b910 lakh.With YouTube demanding TV-like quality, most influencers on this platform have a team that can be up to 30 people. Instagrammers employ freelance photographers and videographers. All of this is done to ensure followers because that\u2019s what attracts the big brands. Platforms like YouTube monetise views to run content-specific ads on the channel, so more views, more money. Even on platforms that are not led by revenue-per-click, brands still pick SMIs based on the number of followers.The frenzy for followers leads to fraud. Swedish e-commerce firm A Good Company and data analytics company HypeAuditor studied millions of Instagram accounts across 82 countries and found that India is No. 3 in the number of fake SMIs (the U.S. and Brazil are No. 1 and 2). This means fake or bot followers.Growing pangsThis, however, doesn\u2019t bother Priyanka Gill, who heads Plixxo, a company that brings brands and SMIs together. She says it is part of how the industry is developing. According to her, this is a nascent stage, and brand managers allow for \u2018discrepancies\u2019 when they sign deals. Plixxo, for example, divides SMIs into Superstars, Super Bloggers, Bloggers, and Campus Ambassadors, with further sub-divisions according to platform. This helps brands pick the influencers they want. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFive reasons to unfollow Instagram influencers \n\n\n\n\nFive reasons to unfollow Instagram influencers Brands are also becoming wiser in the way they\u2019re using SMIs, says Gill, often engaging with them in ways other than just pushing products. For instance, an experienced influencer like Vasudha Rai (over 1.6 lakh followers on Instagram), the former beauty editor for Cosmopolitan and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, is sought after for talks and workshops, often ticketed. And Khan helps automobile companies with confidential brand research projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nAneesh Bhasin \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stars, comedians, and cricketers are still the biggest SMIs, the democratisation of platforms has made the girl or guy next door, whether from big city or small town, brand ambassadors too. \u201cSocial media has opened up a space where everybody has the right to have a voice,\u201d says Vohra.Thus far, brands might have seen a jump in their social media following or a spike in sales immediately after an SMI, say, wears a particular dress. But there\u2019s no tool to measure their exact impact on return of investment or their long-term effectiveness. What is clear, however, is that they are far less expensive than celebrities. Plus, there\u2019s the \u2018accessibility\u2019 factor. As Sengupta says, \u201cWhen Shah Rukh Khan endorses an i10, we all know he\u2019s not driving it,\u201d but an SMI who endorses it could well be driving the car.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnupriya\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMore important, the way an SMI plugs the product doesn\u2019t seem transactional. They seem genuinely interested in the product and are seen to be having fun with it. Thus, when Oppo recently launched model Reno 2, it collaborated with Instagram for a campaign where users had to take creative pictures with the phone while making it seem entirely authentic. This is one reason why no SMI is \u2018perfect\u2019 \u2014 their skin has blemishes; their hair is not always perfectly set; they\u2019re comfortable wearing bikinis even if it means showing cellulite. In short, they can pretend to be a \u2018real\u2019 customer and brands cash in on this relatability.SMIs like Anupriya Kapur, Akanksha Redhu and Kalyan Karmakar, who have been doing this for a while now, know that their reach with brands is mainly due to their loyal followers, so 50-80% of the content they put out is non-branded. \n\n\n\n\n\nMohit Sukhija \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, brands don\u2019t even have to pay for endorsements. Celebrities are encouraged to just pose with products they like. Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder of the Svami line of beverages and an SMI himself, talks of Google Pixel, a phone he endorses. \u201cThey give you the phone and pamper you, but they don\u2019t pay you,\u201d he says. In the same way, Bhasin sends across a case of Svami products to celebs. \u201cIf they post a picture, great. If they don\u2019t, they may serve it to guests, and that\u2019s still good for me.\u201dIt sounds like everyone knows what they are in for, but the real underbelly of social media influencing might just be emerging. Doctors, for instance, are getting on board with large fan followings. While the average SMI is quite obviously pushing a product, it is much harder to tell when doctors are simply doling out friendly advice or when they\u2019re plugging a \u2018friendly\u2019 brand.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Samsung Galaxy Fold smartphone is seen during a media preview event in London, Tuesday April 16, 2019. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP   Samsung has decided to cancel all pre-orders of Galaxy Fold in the U.S., just ahead of its re-launch for buyers who signed on to purchase the device earlier this year.As per Samsung\u2019s email, the pre-orders have been cancelled in order to \u201censure that you have the best possible experience with this revolutionary new technology,\u201d and it notes that the company is rethinking the entire process, including purchasing, unboxing, and service for the Fold (although it doesn\u2019t offer details), the Verge reported on Thursday.The South Korean tech giant reportedly sent out emails to pre-order customers letting them know that their existing pre-orders, many of which were placed in April, have been cancelled. A Samsung representative reportedly highlighted the recently announced \u201cGalaxy Fold Premier Service\u201d that it will be offering for the Galaxy Fold \u2014 presumably part of the new sales process \u2014 and promised more details closer to launch, the report added.According to YouTuber M. Brandon Lee, who first made the email by Samsung public, the smartphone player is also throwing in a $250 credit for free to be redeemed on any product sold directly through its online store. That includes the Galaxy Fold, so in the end, if you decide to re-pre-order it, you\u2019ll get a nice discount for what is definitely one of the most expensive smartphones ever, according to GSMArena.Samsung on Thursday announced that its foldable smartphone will be available in South Korea on September 6 in two colours \u2014 cosmos black and space silver.After its launch in South Korea, the foldable device would also be available in other countries including the U.S., Britain, France and Germany. However, the company did not specify the timeline of the launch in these regions.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Phone numbers linked to more than 400 million Facebook accounts were listed online in the latest privacy lapse for the social media giant, U.S. media reports have said.An exposed server stored 419 million records on users across several databases \u2014 including 133 million records on U.S.-based Facebook users, 18 million records of users in the U.K., and another with more than 50 million records on users in Vietnam, according to technology news site TechCruch.The databases listed Facebook user IDs \u2014 unique digits attached to each account, the profiles\u2019 phone numbers, as well as the gender listed by some accounts and their geographical locations, TechCrunch said.The server was not password-protected, meaning anyone could access the databases, and remained online until late Wednesday when TechCrunch contacted the site\u2019s host. \n\n\n400 million Facebook users' phone numbers exposed\n\n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/Xl8zzeta-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\n\u00a0Facebook confirmed parts of the report but downplayed the extent of the exposure, saying that the number of accounts so far confirmed was around half of the reported 419 million.It added that many of the entries were duplicates and that the data was old.\u201cThe dataset has been taken down and we have seen no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said.Following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, when a firm used Facebook\u2019s lax privacy settings to access millions of users\u2019 personal details, the company disabled a feature that allowed users to search the platform by phone numbers.The exposure of a user\u2019s phone number leaves them vulnerable to spam calls, SIM-swapping \u2014 as recently happened to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \u2014 with hackers able to force-reset the passwords of the compromised accounts.The privacy lapse was discovered by Sanyam Jain, a security researcher and member at Hague-based non-profit organisation GDI Foundation.\u201cJain... found the database and contacted TechCrunch after he was unable to find the owner. After a review of the data, neither could we.

      "\n\nFacebook launches dating services in U.S.\n\n",
      "Updated: September 5, 2019 21:08 IST\rPublished: September 5, 2019 21:08 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-launches-dating-services-in-us/article29343424.ece",
      "\nThis undated product image provide by Facebook shows screenshots of Facebook Dating, a mobile-only matchmaking service. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP   Facebook is tackling a new frontier \u2014 love. Facebook Dating, a matchmaking service the company already offers in Brazil, Canada and 17 other countries, arrives in the U.S. on September 5. But after years of privacy missteps by the social network, will people trust it with their love lives? For a company that\u2019s also developing its own digital currency and dabbling in e-commerce, love is another step toward reaching into all aspects of human existence. Although many features resemble what other matchmaking services offer, Facebook\u2019s version promises to be different, just as Tinder did before it with its swipe action and Bumble with its female-first messaging. Your Facebook Dating profile will be separate from your main one, but it will tap existing features such as events and groups, as well as your network of friends to identify \u201csecret crushes\u201d. Facebook Dating, while being free to use and free of ads, can still help Facebook make money if it keeps people glued to its other services longer. That\u2019s if users can get over concerns about privacy. \u201cA feature on Facebook that people don\u2019t trust isn\u2019t going to be successful,\u201d said Rob Sherman, the company\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer. \u201cWe built in privacy from the ground up.\u201d Tell that to Seth Carter, 32, an engineer from Terre Haute, Indiana, who tried a host of dating apps ranging from Match to Bumble, Tinder and Christian Mingle prior to his current relationship. \u201cFacebook is here to make money and I get that,\u201d he said. But he worries that Facebook\u2019s stated commitment to privacy would ultimately buckle under pressure to make money off the service. \u201cThat likely means they\u2019re going to sell my dating preferences, which means even more intrusions into my life.\u201d Facebook says it won\u2019t be doing any of that. But users like Mr. Carter can hardly be blamed for their apprehension, given the company\u2019s multiple stumbles over protecting people\u2019s private information. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion this summer by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations. It\u2019s also under scrutiny for allowing for the spread of election-related misinformation and discrimination in U.S. housing ads. Facebook Dating comes as the popularity of online dating grows \u2014 In 2016, 15% of all U.S. adults said they had used online dating services, up from virtually none in 2005, according to the Pew Research Center. From old school sites like eHarmony to Hinge or The League, a members-only service promising to bring together folks with \u201cambition and a drive to succeed,\u201d there are also apps focused on farmers, religious groups, seniors, the LGBT community and so on. When he announced the feature in 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook Dating is \u201cnot just for hookups\u201d but to build \u201cmeaningful, long-term relationships\u201d. That appeared to be a direct swipe at Tinder, a service best known for hooking people up with people they find attractive by showing their photo, age and first name. With Facebook, you start by creating a dating profile distinct from your Facebook profile. You can add up to 36 pictures from your Instagram account. You have to be at least 18, rather than 13 with the main Facebook service. When you see a suggested match, you \u201clike\u201d someone by tapping a heart icon, or tap \u201cX\u201d to dislike. There\u2019s no Tinder-like swipe. Facebook Dating won\u2019t suggest your friends as people you might want to date. Your dating profile also won\u2019t show up on your news feed or be visible to friends; it\u2019s only for others using the dating service. Facebook insists it won\u2019t use information gleaned from your dating profiles for advertising and says there won\u2019t be ads on Facebook Dating. To prevent unwanted messages, photos and spam, Facebook Dating lets you message someone just once unless you get a response. Facebook also won\u2019t allow lonely hearts or creeps to send photos or website links, which could help cut down on unsolicited body-part photos. There were initially rumblings that the dating feature might be open only to people who list themselves as \u201csingle\u201d and not those who are \u201cmarried\u201d or \u201cin a relationship.\u201d But Facebook has said this is not the case. After all, people often don\u2019t keep their relationship status up to date or don\u2019t use it in a serious way (in a complicated relationship with pizza, anyone?). To help you meet offline and share interests, the service will also push other Facebook features, such as events and groups. For instance, if you and a match are both going to a concert, you can make plans to meet up there. (These options require you to intentionally activate them.) You can also share your location with friends while on a date, a feature Facebook says has been popular in Colombia and Thailand. But based on Facebook\u2019s history with users\u2019 private information, there\u2019s certainly a possibility that it won\u2019t, so prepare to be embarrassed.

Ltd. on Thursday said its first foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Fold, will be available in South Korea from September 6 with fifth-generation (5G) mobile connectivity.The world\u2019s largest smartphone vendor said the device would be priced 2.398 million won ($1,977.47).The highly anticipated handset was originally due to hit the U.S. market in April but the launch was delayed by screen defects detected in samples.The firm said it would offer 5G and LTE-enabled versions of the Galaxy Fold in select countries including Britain, France, Germany and the United States. It did not provide release dates.Samsung has promised to usher in a new age of foldables as part of its effort to showcase innovation in a saturated smartphone market.The company announced in July it would be ready to sell the Galaxy Fold in September after making changes including strengthening hinges, which early reviewers had found to be problematic.Samsung will provide a program for Fold users in which the company covers 70% of cost of a display screen repair once within a year, according to its statement.\u201cConsumers have responded positively to larger screens, and the Galaxy Fold\u2019s revolutionary form factor offers a bigger, more immersive screen without sacrificing portability,\u201d said D.J. Koh, chief executive of IT & Mobile Communications Division at Samsung Electronics.Last month, Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. delayed the planned September launch of its own first foldable phone, its second postponement this year, as it battles a U.S. trade blacklist that threatens the tech giant\u2019s access to crucial U.S. technologies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Android operating system.SK Telecom Co. Ltd., South Korea\u2019s biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, also on Thursday said it expected Galaxy Fold sales to boost its number of 5G subscribers, offering discounts and insurance plans for the high-priced folding phone.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-rolls-out-face-recognition-kills-tagging-option/article29338588.ece",
      " In a much-needed relief for 2.41 billion users, Facebook is rolling out \u2018Face Recognition\u2019 feature to all, replacing the earlier \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d settings that notified you if someone uploaded a photo and automatically tagged you in it.People who are new to Facebook or who previously had the \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d setting will have the face recognition setting by default and will receive information about how it works.\u201cThe Tag Suggestions setting, which only controls whether we can suggest that your friends tag you in photos or videos using face recognition will no longer be available,\u201d Srinivas Narayanan, Applied Research Lead, Facebook AI, said in a statement on Tuesday.If you have face recognition turned on, Facebook will notify you if someone uploads a photo of you, even if you aren\u2019t tagged.In December 2017, Facebook introduced a new setting for some people called face recognition.\u201cOur face recognition setting lets you manage not only whether Facebook uses face recognition technology on photos of you in order to suggest tags; it provides an easy on or off switch for a broader set of uses of face recognition, such as helping you protect your identity on Facebook,\u201d explained Narayanan. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFacial recognition technology \u2014 is India ready for it?\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFacial recognition technology \u2014 is India ready for it?\nPeople who still have the tag suggestions setting will begin to see a notice in their News Feed.The notice will include information about the new features and options to learn more about how Facebook uses face recognition, along with a button to turn it on or keep it off.\u201cIf you do not currently have the face recognition setting and do nothing, we will not use face recognition to recognise you or suggest tags,\u201d said the social media giant.In addition, features like Photo Review, which lets users know when they appear in photos even if they are not tagged, as long as they have permission to see the post based on its privacy setting, will not be activated.\u201cPeople will still be able to manually tag friends, but we won\u2019t suggest you to be tagged if you do not have face recognition turned on. If you already have the face recognition setting, you won\u2019t receive a notice,\u201d the company added.\u201cWe don\u2019t share your face recognition information with third parties. We also don\u2019t sell our technology,\u201d it noted.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIn this picture taken on August 21, 2019 a woman buys groceries at an IFuree Go self-service supermarket in Tianjin.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: AFP No cash, no cards, no wallet, and no smartphones: China\u2019s shoppers are increasingly purchasing goods with just a turn of their heads as the country embraces facial payment technology.China\u2019s mobile payment infrastructure is one of the most advanced in the world, but the new systems \u2014 which require only face recognition \u2014 being rolled out nationwide could make even QR codes seem old-fashioned.Customers simply make a purchase by posing in front of point-of-sale (POS) machines equipped with cameras, after linking an image of their face to a digital payment system or bank account.\u201cI don\u2019t even have to bring a mobile phone with me, I can go out and do shopping without taking anything,\u201d says Bo Hu, chief information officer of Wedome bakery, which uses facial payment machines across hundreds of stores. The software is already widely used, often to monitor citizens \u2014 it has been credited with nabbing jaywalkers and catching criminals. But authorities have come under fire for using it to crack down and monitor dissent, particularly in China\u2019s surveillance-heavy region of Xinjiang.\u201cThere\u2019s a big risk... that the state could use this data for their own purposes, such as surveillance, monitoring, the tracking of political dissidents, social and information control, ethnic profiling, as in the case with Uighurs in Xinjiang, and even predictive policing,\u201d says Adam Ni, China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney. Despite the concerns over data security and privacy, consumers seem unperturbed as facial recognition payment hits the high streets. Alipay \u2014 the financial arm of ecommerce giant Alibaba \u2014 has been leading the charge in China with devices already in 100 cities. The firm is predicting enormous growth in the sector and recently launched an upgrade of its \u201cSmile-to-Pay\u201d system, using a machine roughly the size of an iPad. Tencent, which runs the WeChat app with 600 million users, unveiled its new facial payment machine called \u201cFrog Pro\u201d last month.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRepresentational image. File \u00a0 | Photo Credit: Reuters  Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, and its YouTube video service will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children's channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to deliver million of dollars in targeted advertisements to those viewers.The settlement with the FTC and the New York attorney general's office, which will receive $34 million, is the largest since a law banning collecting information about children under age 13 came into effect in 1998. The law was revised in 2013 to include \u201ccookies,\u201d used to track a person's internet viewing habits.It is also small compared with the company's revenues. Alphabet, which generates about 85% of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, in July reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion.YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that in four months it would begin treating all data collected from people watching children's content as if it came from a child. \u201cThis means that we will limit data collection and use on videos made for kids only to what is needed to support the operation of the service,\u201d YouTube said on its blog.FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection director Andrew Smith said at a news conference on Wednesday the settlement \u201cis changing YouTube's business model, that YouTube cannot bury its head in the sand, YouTube cannot pretend that it is not aware of the content on its platform and hope to escape liability.\u201d \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube faces fine of $200 mn to settle privacy violation claims\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nYouTube faces fine of $200 mn to settle privacy violation claims\nOnce the settlement takes effect, the FTC plans to \u201cconduct a sweep of the YouTube platform to determine whether there remains child-directed content\u201d in which personal information is being collected, Mr. Smith said. The FTC could take actions against individual content creators or channel owners as a result.In late August, YouTube announced it would launch YouTube Kids with separate niches for children depending on their ages and designed to exclude disturbing videos. It has no behavioral advertising.YouTube allows companies to create channels, which include advertisements that create revenue for both the company and YouTube.In its complaint, the government said that YouTube touted its popularity with children in marketing itself to companies like Mattel and Hasbro. It told Mattel that \u201cYouTube is today\u2019s leader in reaching children age 6-11 against top TV channels,\u201d according to the complaint.\u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. \u201dYet when it came to complying with (federal law banning collecting data on children), the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids.\u201dNew York Attorney General Letitia James said the companies \u201dabused their power.\u201d\u201cGoogle and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,\u201d said James.In addition to the monetary fine, the proposed settlement requires the company to refrain from violating the law in the future and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children.The two Democrats on the FTC, Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, dissented from the settlement. Ms. Slaughter, who called the violations \u201cwidespread and brazen,\u201d said the settlement fails to require YouTube to police channels that provide children's content but do not designate it as such, thus allowing more lucrative behavioral advertising, which relies on tracking viewers through cookies.Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats active in online privacy matters, criticized the settlement in separate statements.\u201cA financial settlement is no substitute for strict reforms that will stop Google and other tech companies from invading our privacy,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cI continue to be alarmed by Big Techs policies and practices that invade children's lives.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hacking-of-twitter-ceo-jack-dorseys-account-highlights-dangers-of-sim-swap-fraud/article29331849.ece",
      "\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey, File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: Reuters  Even with considerable security precautions in place, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey became the victim of an embarrassing compromise when attackers took control of his account on the platform by hijacking his phone number.Mr. Dorsey became the latest target of so-called \"SIM swap\" fraud which enables a fraudster to trick a mobile carrier into transferring a number \u2014 potentially causing people to lose control not only of social media, but bank accounts and other sensitive information.This type of attack targets a weakness in \"two factor authentication\" via text message to validate access to an account, which has become a popular break-in method in recent years.Twitter said on August 30 the account was restored after a brief time in which the attackers posted a series of offensive tweets.But Ori Eisen, founder of Arizona-based security firm Trusona, which specializes in authentication without passwords, said the rapid fix should not be seen as an answer to the broad problem of SIM swap fraud.\"The problem is not over,\" Eisen said, noting that these kinds of attacks have been used to take over other high-profile social media accounts and for various kinds of fraud schemes.Mr. Eisen said it's not clear how many people are attacked in this manner but that automated technology can create billions of calls that lure people into giving up information or passwords.Some analysts say hackers have found ways to easily get enough information to get a telecom carrier to transfer a number to a fraudster's account, especially after hacks of large databases which result in personal data sold on the so-called \"dark web\".\"Mobile accounts' text messages can be hijacked by sophisticated hardware techniques, but also by so-called 'social engineering' \u2014 convincing a mobile provider to migrate your account to another, unauthorised phone,\" said R. David Edelman, a former White House adviser who heads a cybersecurity research centre at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\"It only takes a few minutes of confusion to make mischief like Dorsey experienced.\"Thousands of these attacks have been reported in countries where mobile payments are common, including in Brazil, Mozambique, India and Spain.Researchers at the security firm Kaspersky say security systems by many mobile operators \"are weak and leave customers open to SIM swap attacks\" especially if the attackers are able to gather information such as birth dates and other data.In a recent blog post, Kaspersky researchers Fabio Assolini and Andre Tenreiro said some cases come from cybercriminals paying off corrupt employees of mobile carriers \u2014 for as little as $10 to $15 per victim.\"The interest in such attacks is so great among cybercriminals that some of them decided to sell it as a service to others,\" the researchers wrote.In Brazil, some criminals have taken over victims' WhatsApp accounts, using it to ask the person's friends for \"urgent payment,\" Mr. Assolini and Mr. Tenreiro wrote.\"This is a pretty ripe avenue for fraud,\" said Joseph Hall, technologist at the Centre for Democracy & Technology in Washington.Mr. Hall said some carriers are using artificial intelligence to separate the legitimate SIM card replacements from fraud, but that this has not been universally deployed.\"I would blame the carriers for not having more robust ways to authenticate users,\" he added, while also calling on Twitter to offer better safeguards.A faked tweet from the President or other prominent person could lead to \"devastating consequences,\" such as a plunge in financial markets, Mr. Hall said.\"This kind of thing becomes hard to counteract, because even after the information comes out that it's a hoax, people may not believe it,\" he said.The Dorsey case, Mr. Hall said, highlights the need for better forms of authentication, especially for large online platforms like Facebook and Twitter where messages can have an impact.This could involve a physical key that plugs into a device or a software-based system such as Google Authenticator, Mr. Hall noted.Mr. Eisen said that paradoxically, the push for longer and more complex passwords has led to greater use of insecure text messages for authentication.\"The security practitioners must come to terms with the fact that what used to work doesn't work now,\" he said.\"We need to look for solutions that are not so easily exploited by bad guys and are easy for people to adopt.\"You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nFree opinion: Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, CEO of Telefonica, Spain, has published over 36,000 tweets since 2010. \u00a0 Most chief executive officers (CEOs) in India remain relatively inaccessible to consumers on social media as compared to their counterparts in Europe and the United States.An ECCO International study, that looked at the largest companies by market capitalisation in 21 countries worldwide, showed that 58% of global CEOs were active on LinkedIn, compared to only 20% of Indian CEOs. For Twitter, this was 17% worldwide and just 10% for India.Uday Kotak, CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank, was rated as one the leading CEOs globally on social media with nearly a million followers on Twitter. However, Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group and who has 7.2 million followers on Twitter, did not figure in the list. Asked for a reason, a spokesperson for the ECCO network said the study covered the top 25 Indian firms in terms of market capitalisation. Since, M&M did not figure in this list, Mr. Mahindra was not a part of the study, the spokesperson said. CEOs in France were the most active on social media, followed by those in Denmark. Australia and Netherlands shared the third position. As per a similar study conducted in 2017, CEOs in the U.S. had by far the most followers, despite the country ranking fifth in terms of total presence on social media. Apple CEO Tim Cook continues to top the chart worldwide with more than 11 million followers on Twitter (an increase of 120% over 2017). Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft, leads the way on LinkedIn, with over six million followers (an increase of 300% over 2017). Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, CEO of Telefonica, Spain, is the most active CEO on Twitter and has published over 36,000 tweets since 2010 (an average of 10 tweets per day).  ECCO \u2014 a network of independent PR and marketing communications\u2019 agencies across over 40 countries \u2014 has analysed social media behaviour of CEOs across 21 nations for the study.Bhavya Doshi, assistant vice president, ECCO in India, said, \u201cMore and more CEOs are active worldwide on the LinkedIn career network and in almost all countries Most CEOs continue to shy away from communication on Twitter, as the language is often more pointed on this platform and hence the risk of backlash from consumers is significantly higher. \u201cWith LinkedIn, this risk is lower and [so], more CEOs are recognising opportunities on this channel.\u2019\u2019You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

After all, we have some impressive design schools, interior designers sharing their wit and major retailers where we can realise our visual dreams.That said, with most of the city looking forward to Hyderabad Design Week (HDW) in October \u2014 which will focus on promoting innovation, encouraging design thinking, fostering continued design education, and creating awareness on the power of design in India \u2014 the campaign video upped the hype for the forthcoming festival.Mumbai-based Post Office Studios has seen major evolution over the four to five years of their lifetime so far, largely because they kept an ear to the ground for emerging technologies and shifting climates around design. Naturally, the HDW video is a lively mosaic of colour and character. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0CCO Aditya Tawde, who\u2019s also the director of the video, speaks about his and his team\u2019s experience bringing the video together. They were approached by the Government of Telangana for the project. He explains time wasn\u2019t on their side but there was a lot of creative and technical decision-making to make sure they encompassed the diverse world of design in just a few minutes. \u201cWe wanted to explore various design forms like 2D and 3D animation along with some fun live action shots, to make the messaging of the narrative more comprehensible,\u201d recalls Aditya.So what was the goal here? \u201cTheir main task was to create a video that was as innovative and unconventional as possible, while ensuring that we did justice to the event\u2019s theme: Humanizing Design,\u201d Aditya responds, \u201cGiven the leeway we had for this project, as well as the nature and scale of the event in particular, we wanted to create a content piece that would in some way be an ode to design. The team conceptualised a spoken word piece highlighting how design has evolved around human experiences over the years, each of which would be visually depicted with a distinct design style.\u201d"

      "#BoycottRedLabel was one of the most popular hashtags on Twitter in India on Sunday, as thousands of users bristled at an 11-month-old advertisement of the tea brand with Ganesh Chaturthi as its theme. Holding placards and sharing posters to declare the boycott, users claimed the advertisement targeted Hindus, portraying them as \u201cintolerant\u201d.Appealing to the Hindustan Unilever Limited, which owns the brand, to remove the ads, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti tweeted: \u201cWe appeal Red Label Chai and HUL News to remove ads insulting religious sentiments of Hindus and apologise to Hindu Community\u201d. In the more than two-minute-long advertisement, which Red Label claims is inspired by a true story, a man visits a Ganesh idol sculptor ahead of the festival. However, realising the sculptor is a Muslim, as he puts on a skull cap hearing a prayer call, the buyer hesitates - deferring the purchase to the next day. Yet, later when the two have the brand\u2019s tea, together, the buyer fixes the deal the same moment. \u201cWhat happens when a cup of tea breaks deep-rooted prejudice?\u201d reads the video\u2019s description on Youtube. One user, suggesting a happy ending, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see how a Hindu is being projected as intolerant. It could have been a happy ad where the Hindu man gets excited after knowing the artist is a Muslim and both could have felt proud on India\u2019s diversity & pluralism.\u201d Most users shared a post created by the Samiti which read: \u201cRed Label put the label of intolerant on Hindus in the ad.\u201d By evening, more than 33,000 users had given a call on Twitter to boycott the brand and Hindustan Unilever Limited, which drew flak in March for an advertisement of Surf Excel, another of its products, promoting Hindu-Muslim harmony on Holi. One user wrote: \u201cRedlabel - you don\u2019t have to teach us to be peaceful. We are already peaceful religion and don\u2019t bother. Boycott all HUL products\u201d. Another said, \u201c#BoycottRedLabel why? Because they shove their one sided agenda down our throats and always make Hindus look bad.\u201dOn Bakrid this year, many of the 45,000 users, who had vouched for an \u201ceco-friendly Eid\u201d, had shared posts curated by the Samiti. Recently, Twitter users gave a call to boycott food aggregators Zomato and Uber Eats and restaurant chain McDonald\u2019s for \u201churting sentiments\u201d of Hindus. Parth M. N., a journalist, hit back at critics tweeting: \u201cAt this rate, the boycott industry will eventually have to boycott itself.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "The story so far: Shifting gears in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), the NITI Aayog, in May this year, proposed to ban the sale of all internal combustion engine (ICE) powered three-wheelers post March 2023. It also suggested that all new two-wheelers below 150cc sold after March 2025 should be electric. In consonance with these proposals, the Union Budget presented on July 5 announced tax incentives for early adopters. Even as the automobile industry had objected to the think-tank\u2019s proposal and called for a practical approach in framing electric vehicle-related policies, there has been the worry that EVs are still not financially viable because of various costs associated with their manufacture and use.The portion of the costs of the drivetrain of EVs \u2014 the system in a motor vehicle which connects the transmission to the drive axles \u2014 in comparison to the cost of the entire vehicle is four percentage points lower when compared to ICE vehicles. This is primarily due to less parts in the electric drivetrain. However, the battery pack takes up nearly half the cost of an electric vehicle. For any meaningful reduction in the physical value of EVs, the cost of battery packs needs to reduce significantly. Chart 1 compares the cost breakdown of a conventional ICE vehicle with an electric vehicle. Chart 2 compares the drivetrain cost breakdown between the two kinds.The predominant battery chemistry used in EVs is lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion). No new technologies are on the horizon for immediate commercial usage.The cost of the materials or key-components of the battery, namely the cathode, anode, electrolyte, separator, among others, contribute the most (60%) to the total cost. Labour charges, overheads and profit margins account for the rest.Labour is a relatively minuscule component of the overall cost. Any reduction in the cost of the battery pack will have to come from a reduction in materials cost or the manufacturing overhead. The graph shows the cost split of a Li-ion battery pack.The price of these battery packs has consistently fallen over the past few years. This decrease is in part due to technological improvements, economies of scale and increased demand for lithium-ion batteries. Fierce competition between major manufacturers has also been instrumental in bringing down prices.The chart shows the change in the price of Li-ion batteries from 2010 to 2016. It is not clear if the battery cost can be reduced even further. Given that raw materials account for 60% of the cost of the battery pack, the room for further cost reduction is rather limted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0In India, EV adoption will be driven by two-wheelers rather than cars in high numbers on because India\u2019s mobility market is driven more by two wheelers. According to the NITI Aayog, 79% of vehicles on Indian roads are two-wheelers.Three-wheelers and cars that cost less than \u20b910 lakh account for 4% and 12% of the vehicle population, respectively.Two-wheelers will also need smaller batteries when compared to cars and hence the overall affordable cost.India needs to manufacture Li-ion cells in-house. Now, cells are imported and \u201cassembled\u201d into batteries. Setting up a Li-ion manufacturing unit requires high capital expenditure. But battery manufacturing in India is expected to grow as electric vehicles grow.In conventional ICEs, petrol or diesel fuels the engine. However, in EVs, batteries are not the fuel; electrons supplied by the battery fuel the vehicle. The battery is a device that stores electrons/energy which is sourced from electricity.Presently, most of India\u2019s electricity is generated using conventional sources. In 2018-19, over 90% of India\u2019s electricity was generated from conventional sources, including coal, and around 10% was produced from renewable sources such as solar, wind and biomass. While the rate of electricity generated from renewable sources has increased over the years, more needs to be done for their adoption.This is because the EV-charging infrastructure needs to be powered through renewable sources to make it truly sustainable.Dr. S.

      "\n\nDear Pari: A podcast series on adoption \n",

      "Adoption is a big subject for a podcast to tackle. How do you find every kind of stakeholder in this complex web of relationships, from parents (who get, who give, and those who wait) and children to agencies, counsellors, and lawyers? How do you balance the personal and the societal, the cultural and the regulatory, the numbers and the narratives? How do you weave it all together in a compelling manner that keeps people listening through 12 episodes (and counting)?Dear Pari does exactly that. Drawing from a personal adoption story, SunoIndia editor Padma Priya and co-producer Rakesh Kamal detail the twists and turns in the journey, from registering with the Central Adoption Resource Agency to bringing home a child to negotiating the complex issues of belonging, alienation and identity. \u201cA podcast format seemed like a perfect fit for this theme,\u201d says Padmapriya. \u201cAudio offers the kind of privacy and anonymity that is needed for such a topic... where the stories could be listened to without judgment... it certainly can\u2019t be told on YouTube.\u201dReflectionsWhile each episode begins with a reflection on their own adoption journey, the hosts very quickly jump into the larger issues facing the community of adoptive parents, children, and the entire system of governance and support.\u201cIt was tough to balance the need to tell our own story while protecting our child\u2019s privacy,\u201d notes Padma Priya. \u201cWe were very aware that she might listen to it one day,\u201d adds Kamal. They consciously chose to \u201cnot shy away\u201d from topics that did not stem from their experience. \u201cMy training as a reporter helped me develop some distance, and bring in a wide range of sources and voices,\u201d says Padmapriya.The eight episodes that make up the first season of Dear Pari feature a variety of voices, some of which tell extremely moving and even disturbing stories. While Episode 3 (\u2018All about the law\u2019) delves into the intricacies of the laws governing adoption in India, Episode 5 (\u2018The heart speaks\u2019) contains two contrasting experiences of adoptees. In \u2018Closing the triad\u2019 (Episode 9), we hear the rare voice of a mother who gave up her child for adoption, in the process challenging several widely held preconceptions. Adoptive parentsOne of the toughest episodes for the team to record was with child rights activist Arun Dohle (Episodes 7 and 8), who holds that society and systems need to focus on a reunification and rehabilitation of children within their communities rather than on adoption \u2014 a position that sees adoptive parents as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d. Says Padmapriya, \u201cEven though it was hard for us, as adoptive parents, to hear this, it was important to have all these views out there.\u201dThe second season of Dear Pari, which launched in July this year, pushes the theme further, exploring adoptions by non-resident Indians, the role of teachers and schools, the barriers to adoption of older children and those with special needs. With close to 25,000 downloads, the SunoIndia team believes the series has started a more nuanced conversation around adoption, both within and outside the adoptive community.Now the team has embarked on an even more ambitious project, with their new podcast The Lost Child, which takes a close look at the lives of children in shelter homes. But that, as they say, is a whole \u2018nother story.(A fortnightly series on podcasts.)The Hyderabad-based writer and academic is a neatnik fighting a losing battle with the clutter in her head.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

File \u00a0 | Photo Credit: Reuters   Google will pay $150-200 million to settle allegations that YouTube violated a children\u2019s privacy law while gathering data to better target its adverts, U.S. media reports said on Friday.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission agreed the amount of the settlement against YouTube parent Google, which if approved by the Justice Department would be the largest settlement in a case involving children\u2019s privacy, the New York Times reported. The allegations against YouTube were made by privacy groups who said the platform had violated laws protecting children\u2019s privacy by gathering data on users under the age of 13 without obtaining permission from parents, Politico reported. The FTC is expected to announce its decision on the settlement in September, the New York Times said. U.S. regulators have long argued Google fails to protect children from harmful content and data collection on its YouTube platform. Advocacy group \u2018The Center for Digital Democracy\u2019 said in a statement that the proposed settlement would be \u201cwoefully low\u201d given Google\u2019s size and revenue, and called on the FTC to \u201cenjoin Google from committing further violations\u201d of children\u2019s privacy law. Google remains the money-making engine for parent company Alphabet, with most of its revenue coming from digital ads, which accounted for $116 billion of the $136 billion the Silicon Valley-based company took in last year. In January, France\u2019s CNIL data watchdog slapped Google with a record 50-million-euro fine for failing to meet the EU\u2019s tough General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force early last year. Google is appealing the fine. Fellow U.S. tech giant Facebook recently settled a record $5 billion fine with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for misusing users\u2019 private data.

      "\n(Left to right) Ayushi Amin and Rytasha Rathore \u00a0 The journey began on a school bus, when two 13-year-old girls, Rytasha Rathore and Ayushi Amin, decided to sit next to each other. \u201cOK, it is not quite that romantic,\u201d laughs Rathore. \u201cIt took us two years to even start speaking to each other,\u201d concurs Amin. You can listen to the rest of their tale \u2014 how they became BFFs, how they define adulthood, and when they first felt like grown-ups \u2014 on the first episode of their podcast, Agla Station Adulthood, out now on IVM Podcasts. The duo has come a long way since. Rathore is now a freelance actor/model and vociferous body positive Instagram influencer, with close to 70,000 followers. Amin, on the other hand, is in the trade and commerce industry. They already have a second episode out, which dropped earlier this week, called Adulting 101. \u201cYou know, the consummate struggles of paying bills, handling responsibilities and still having the kind of social life that we all covet,\u201d Rathore says. Women in their 20s and 30s everywhere will relate to the tone, which ranges from good-natured ribbing to frank observations. The show itself came about quite organically, say the hosts. A guest stint on Cyrus Broacha\u2019s podcast, Cyrus Says, introduced Rathore to IVM co-founder, Kavita Rajwade. Incidentally, Rajwade had been looking to create a podcast that gave a platform for female voices. \u201cRytasha fit that part, given her opinion on body image and the way she slams societal beauty norms. Ayushi came on board for the pilot, and since she was just as bold and unapologetic, I was convinced that their chemistry will make for some very interesting conversations,\u201d explains Rajwade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe medium itself is novel territory for the girls. While Amin was initially nervous, Rathore insisted they \u201cchat like we normally do\u201d. For the first season, they\u2019re aiming at 12 to 15 shows that speak to millennial listeners. \u201cIt might be a hit with some older individuals as well, giving them an insight into what we are really going through,\u201d shares Amin. As of now, guests are not on the cards. \u201cAyushi and I just cannot get enough of each other,\u201d quips Rathore. The aim of the podcast is to tell listeners that whatever problem they have, they are not alone. Rathore\u2019s goal is to create a safe space for honest conversations. \u201cOur generation also has the highest pressure to be successful, woke, decent, politically correct... We can all grow together, and hopefully, make the world a better place,\u201d she says, of her Utopian dream. For Amin, if you listen to an episode and \u201cfeel even minutely reassured about what you\u2019re going through\u201d, then they\u2019ve done what they set out to do. "

      "Updated: August 30, 2019 11:45 IST\rPublished: August 29, 2019 23:27 IST",

      "Telangana\u2019s Information Technology, Electronics & Communications Department, after having successfully launched the face recognition technology app for the benefit of pensioners to obtain \u2018life certificate\u2019 for the first time in the country, now wishes to extend it to other forms of governance.To begin with, the department through Chief Secretary S.K. Joshi has sounded the Election Commission of India (ECI) to try out three factor identification of this technology to clean up voters list of multiple Elector Photo Identity Cards (EPICs) and duplicates.The face recognition technology, currently being tested in Hyderabad and Bengaluru airports, has been adopted by the IT Department to enable pensioners to \u2018prove their existence\u2019 to respective banks, sub-treasury offices or Meeseva centres.All it needs is a \u2018selfie\u2019 from a smart phone or a \u2018live\u2019 photo taken by any of the kith and kin routed through the \u2018T App folio\u2019 and this is immediately cross-checked with the available records. Technology can easily make out if the photo is that of a \u2018live\u2019 person or just a photo. So far 4,000 pensioners made use of it and more are expected from November onwards when the annual \u2018liveness certificate\u2019 is required to be submitted.\u201cWe did a soft launch in April and are very pleased with the application. We expect more pensioners to make use of the technology as they need not go to any office and only need access to a smart phone. Since most citizens have to go to government offices for establishing identity, this technology has immense potential to change the governance rules,\u201d says Commissioner (Electronic Service Delivery) & Special Commissioner (e-governance) G.T. Venkateswar Rao. Immediate resonance could be in cleaning up electoral lists as the Aadhaar biometrics identity link-up was halted by the Supreme Court. \u201cFace recognition is not only digitally verifiable but is also quick with least manual intervention and is highly accurate with three factor verification. There is no need for fingerprint or Iris scanners,\u201d says Mr. Rao.With help of artificial intelligence based liveness testing, big data mining and deep learning based image comparison apart from biometrics, it is possible to identify a person through a photograph, even if there are certain changes in the profile over a period of time of even 20 years.It was to be tested it in recent local body polls but top officials decided to sound the ECI as it is the custodian of voters lists and this solution could facilitate its objective of \u2018One Voter, One EPIC Card.\u2019 With help of a smart phone or tab, a one time authentication of voters identity can easily be established during summary revision of electoral rolls in real time for issuance of digital EPICs, he adds.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Remedy has gone with tried-and-tested third-person shooter mechanics. As Jesse progresses, peeling layers off The Hiss, by cleansing places of power, she picks up new Jedi-like powers along the way. Like the ability to levitate, shield herself with debris, hurl objects at devastating speeds at the enemies and more. Her powers unleash some serious devastation at the fairly lacklustre enemies.The graphics engine does an excellent job of breaking stuff apart, and the fights generally get tense and look beautiful with all that debris flying about.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab from Control by Remedy Entertainment \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Service Weapon, an auto-loading handgun that can be upgraded with better powers, is also fun. Soon you will find yourself pumping supernatural ammo into bad guys while leaping, like some sort of superhero. The other times you feel lost and confused, hanging on to your mini-map like a lifebuoy in deep water.While the environments contain a lot of detail, as a whole, the game can get a little gloomy and boring. It feels like a trudge in many of the levels, as you have to find your way around the claustrophobic corridors and more empty spaces (albeit with interesting geometric disturbances) \u2014 it just feels hollow. Control is a really good action game but lacks the heart that Quantum Break, Max Payne or Alan Wake had. It attempts to introduce an interesting realm, which combines the supernatural with shady government organisations meddling into things of which they know nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab from Control by Remedy Entertainment \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nControl pulls this off with fresh originality.Known for bending the laws of physics to create excellent video games, Remedy Entertainment has carved a neat little niche for themselves. It blew everyone\u2019s minds with Max Payne (2001), which was one of the first action games to add the Matrix-like bullet-time slow motion. The studio played around with light in Alan Wake, a Stephen King novel-like horror game. Quantum Break witnessed time distortions. And, in their latest edition, they have played around with matter.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSteve Waugh at the Bradman Museum (Bowral, New South Wales, Australia) with Don Bradman\u2019s bat \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nGoogle Arts & Culture\n Google Arts & Culture (GAC) has launched \u2018Australia: Great Sporting Land\u2019, an immersive online exhibit that invites fans to explore the people, places, and moments that have shaped Australia\u2019s sporting culture and the stories behind some of the most popular games. The digital exhibit, which is the result of three years of research, offers content that engages and resonates with sports lovers around the globe, especially cricket, given Australia\u2019s great tradition in the game.Program Manager, GAC, Suhair Khan, explains the extent of the research. In the past, \u201cMost of the work has primarily been around history, monuments, and culture. This is the first-ever GAC project that explores and celebrates the realm of sports as a culture. For this project, our team has worked closely in collaboration with 30+ partners (sporting institutions, stadiums, commentators, athletes, fans), who contributed over 11,000 images and videos and 200 artworks and artefacts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet View of Melbourne Cricket Ground, also known simply as \u2018The G\u2019, an Australian sports stadium located in Yarra Park, Melbourne, Victoria.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nGoogle Arts & Culture\n \n\n\n\n\nThe platform gives unprecedented access to sporting memorabilia, moments, and museums. \u201cWe are exploring the role sport has played in shaping the culture of a country. Following extensive research, we have tried to contextualise it and provide it with historical relevance on a global stage. That in itself is an incredible experience.\u201dSuhair\u2019s favourite feature is on Blind Cricket History. \u201cIt shows how Australians paved the way for disabled persons (and mixed gender teams) with gusto, inventing the game of Blind Cricket.\u201d The story about the North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, with 6,000-plus items from their collection, is, according Suhair, \u201csuch a wonderful blend of the best of old and new in Australian lifesaving. Plus, it features an iconic beach and ocean. As a non-Aussie, it\u2019s very evocative of Australia!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the National Archives of Australia: Champion surfer Mark Warren at Surfers Paradise\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nGoogle Arts & Culture\n \n\n\n\n\nCricket fans would love \u2018The Away Change Room Doors\u2019.

The change room doors document tales of the past and present players, and their achievements at the ground. These doors feature a list of Australian domestic and international bowlers and batsmen.

The replica has signatures of Indian cricket stars like Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and Yuvraj Singh, and many more Indian and international players.\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet View of the Australian National Surfing Museum, in Torquay, Victoria, which is widely cited as hosting the world's largest surfing and beach culture museum.\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nGoogle Arts & Culture\n \n\n\n\n\nTo make sure we visit the page, Suhair says, \u201cRecognising the great sporting rivalry that India shares with the Aussies, this is an excellent opportunity for fans to relive some incredible moments in the history of cricket, through archival footage, new film and interviews, and newly digitised assets from important cricketing collections, which are coming online for the first time.\u201dSteve Waugh, one of the legends of modern cricket, had a 19-year-career \u2014 46 of his 168 Tests were played in the Ashes and 10 of his 32 centuries were in the series, the unbeaten 177 at Leeds in 1989, his favourite. Here, he talks about the significance of the Ashes.What is your reaction to sport being included in Google\u2019s Arts and Culture project? It is a natural fit.

      "\n\n\u2018Shuddh Digital Romance\u2019 at Bengaluru\u2019s Gender Bender 2019: how dating apps have changed intimacy\n\n",
      "Updated: August 28, 2019 15:21 IST\rPublished: August 26, 2019 17:17 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-dating-apps-have-changed-intimacy/article29260469.ece",
      "In these days of swiping left and right on dating apps, a perspective on love and intimacy seems to be lacking. This perhaps explains the huge turnout at the panel discussion, Shuddh Digital Romance, held as part of Gender Bender 2019 at the Bangalore International Centre recently. Filmmaker and writer Paromita Vohra, brand strategy and communications manager at Tinder, Rashi Wadhera and Tejas AP, head of Research Communications at Azim Premji University discussed various aspects of dating apps, ranging from design to user experience.\u201cWhat is the first question you have been asked on a dating app?\u201d Paromita asked the audience. After answers like, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 and \u2018How are you?\u2019, Paromita said, \u201cThe question often asked is, \u2018What are you looking for?\u2019 It suggests a binary \u2014 are you looking for something casual or serious? The huge grey area of \u2018I am not sure\u2019 or \u2018let\u2019s see where this goes\u2019 is usually not considered. This is because there aren\u2019t many takers for the uncertain.\u201dTejas raised questions on how dating apps are designed. \u201cThis aspect plays a huge role in either encouraging a conversation or discouraging it. You quantify your sexuality and desires in a very particular manner. For example, the backlash against Grindr has been that it\u2019s an app for awful hook-ups and a lot of body shots. Grindr has also led to a lot of body shaming, and that has had an impact on how people view themselves and others.\u201dTo this analysis, Paromita observed, \u201cWhen we talk about dating apps, we have to talk about Capitalism. Since a lot of apps are free, they have to be incentivised in some form.There is an encouragement to keep swiping. It is an essentially numerical way of existing. When we use the word Shuddh (pure), what we need to think about is the digital self. On one hand, it can be liberating because you can be whoever you want to be, and on the other hand, the way you are projected is restricted by the design of the app.\u201d Rashi made a case for Tinder. \u201cThe standard experience on Tinder doesn\u2019t change no matter how much money you pay. It is a free model and not ad based. We don\u2019t track user conversations because we are subscription based. People also use Tinder for jobs and friendships. I also believe the way we interact with the app changes over time. So it is best not to give it a tag because every label we give is biased and based on our experience.\u201dParomita said dating apps limit interactions. \u201cSo much of our personality is defined by professions and social standing. Apps are quite like the vendors who sell t-shirts in heaps where they keep jumbling it so that the good stuff comes to the surface. Likewise, apps have created a churn of desire. I would say there is an overwhelming \u2018straightness\u2019 to apps because they push you towards \u2018coupling up\u2019 rather than figuring out what you may like.And that is why apps may \u2018flatten out interactive experiences\u2019, which is making people feel lonely.\u201d Rashi said there was more \u2018smartphone adoption\u2019 by men than women \u201cAbout 84 % men are more romantic as against 79 % women.\u201d Paromita argued that \u2018romantic\u2019 can\u2019t be easily defined.At the end of the discussion, there was a consensus among the audience that whether good or bad, apps have made society more image-conscious.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nStandby mode \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  The concept of the smart home holds a dazzle, thanks to the likes of Marvel\u2019s Jarvis. Surveillance woes aside, the tech ecosystem has rolled out some jarringly intelligent devices this year, many of which cater to the Tony Stark in us.So, when Google announced the Nest Hub at this year\u2019s I/O, my initial response was excitement followed by a \u2018so what?\u2019 What would set this apart from others in this competitive market? As the name explains, the Nest Hub is literally a central unit to cohesively integrate all your smart-home devices. So how well does it pull this off?After you\u2019ve enjoyed the so-called \u2018peel porn\u2019 by removing the polythene plastic encasing from the brand new box, the box holds minimal paper in pamphlet form (everything is online after all), the Nest Hub sitting in a case and its two-pin 1.5-metre power cable. No frills, no fuss, no unwanted wires here.SpecificationsDimensions: Depth: 2.65 in (67.3 mm), Width: 7.02 in (178.3 mm), Height: 4.65 in (118.1 mm)Power cable: 1.5 m with a 15W adapter with a DC power jackWeight: 16.9 oz (480 g)Display: 7-inch LCD touch screenSensors: Capacitive touch, Ambient lightSpeaker: Full range speakerMicrophones: 2 mic array, Mic switchConnectivity: 802.11b/g/n/ac (2.4GHz/5Ghz) Wi-Fi , Bluetooth\u00ae 5.0 supportWhen we mull over smart home devices, we want convenience, we want speed, and we want zero-fuss \u2014 but we also demand a fetching design, and the Nest Hub wins here. At its fairly compact size of the 7-inch screen and light weight of just under 500 grams, it shouldn\u2019t be a burden in a home that most likely has cinematic screens and monitors. Nest Hub, which requires to be plugged in to function, fits into any space, including your bathroom if you\u2019re that extra... but I\u2019d avoid that because the speaker at the rear of the device is covered in grille cloth which could get wet. Its uncluttered display is helpful to those not necessarily standing close to the device, but wanting to read the time on its Standby screen. This is probably due to the fact that while most Google Assistant devices run on some form of Android Things, the Nest Hub is a little different, thriving on a similar system to Chromecast. Nest Hub throws up Google Maps visualisations, plays YouTube videos, displays your music streaming feed (YouTube Music, Gaana, JioSaavn, Wynk, and Spotify) and also exhibits your daily or weekly weather forecasts. During Standby Mode, there\u2019s also the option to have a looping slideshow from your Google Photos archive which you can customise. The screen itself is intuitive, automatically adjusting tone and brightness as per its environment\u2019s lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative screengrab of Google Home app linked with the Nest Hub \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you can vocally control the Nest Hub freely, it\u2019s only fair to speak extensively on the Nest Hub\u2019s life force: the Google Home app, which controls the device\u2019s more intricate functions, on your smartphone voice with a simple \u201cOkay, Google.\u201d The microphone strength of the Nest Hub needs a little work, its sensitivity is quite low, so you\u2019ll have to be in a certain range to communicate vocally with it.If you have a lot of people at home and you want to provide Nest Hub sovereignty to a select few or just one person, there\u2019s a Voice Recognition option, which is fairly standard for this genre of devices.The Google Home app makes sure connecting the Nest Hub to smart-home-enabled devices in your periphery is no tough task. Pretty much all of India\u2019s home automation brands (all part of a growing market set to be valued at over \u20b930,000 crore by 2022) are optimised for Google Home. You name it, it\u2019s ready: Philips Hue, SmartThings, Ring, etcetera. If you connect your Nest Hub to your smart-lighting like I did, it\u2019s fairly easy to control the light intensity down to the percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative image of one of the Nest Hub\u2019s settings\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that\u2019s all put out there, enter Nest Hub\u2019s Routines feature, designed to help you kick off your day. It customises as per your wake-up or go-to-bed regimen: alarms, get-ready playlists, lights turned on, live traffic and weather analyses \u2014 it does it all. All you have to do is beat your own internal clock. Well, that\u2019s an area prone to human error no known smart device can fix... yet.As a first Google Home display device, this one is a pretty decent release. The Nest Hub Max, its big brother, is a larger version with marginal differences at a glance.Nest Hub is attractively priced at \u20b99,999, a little steeper than the $79.99 Lenovo Smart Clock, but I figure you\u2019re forking over the extra cash for the Google brand.Google Nest Hub is available for purchase in India from today (August 26) at Flipkart, Croma, Reliance and TATA Cliq.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nBlast from the past: Players try their hand at Pacman at Gamescom in Cologne.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Clunky games consoles with blobby pixels might not be the latest thing \u2014 but they\u2019re still cool even if you\u2019re no longer at school.Video games producers plying their wares at Gamescom this week in Cologne, Germany, may primarily be out to push the frontiers of hi-tech and virtual reality as they eye a bigger slice of a booming market. But their commercial antennae are sufficently honed to realise numerous hands on the joystick belong to gamers for whom retro hasn\u2019t so much come back as never gone away.That much was evident from the interest shown towards those who brought along vintage hardware which the uninitiated might have thought had long been left to gather dust in the attic.So-called \u201cretrogaming\u201d \u2014 digging out favourite classic games of yesteryear to be played on equally ageing hardware \u2014 is trending at Gamescom, Europe\u2019s gaming fair.That much is clear from seeing a sea of enraptured faces as visitors drool over machines from right back in the early days.For some old school gamers, it\u2019s a welcome blast from the past.For others, the past is their present, be it indulging original vintage passions on old machines, \u2018emulating\u2019 a game simulated on a new machine or \u2018porting\u2019 to enjoy old content on new hardware.\u201cIt reminds me of my childhood and today I realise that the games in those days could also be complex,\u201d laughs Jackye Mueller, a 21-year-old student trying to snaffle virtual bananas while playing old favourite Donkey Kong on a Super Nintendo.Nearby, a father is waxing lyrical on the attractions of another classic game, \u201cPong\u201d, to his young son.The early arcade game, launched in 1972, involves each player manipulating a virtual cursor-like tennis \u2018racquet\u2019 to ping the ball back across a screen of simple 2D graphics to win the \u2018point\u2019.\u201cRetro is everywhere \u2014 in films, music, cars, clothes. So why not games?\u201d asks Christian Gleinser, creator of a cohort of new games which work on computers \u2018boasting\u2019 1980s graphics.\u201cPeople like to have fun among friends and appreciate the ease of use, the short charging times and even the old pixels,\u201d says Gleinser against the fair\u2019s musical backdrop of the likes of Sonic, Mario Kart or Pokemon.Some dyed-in-the-wool gamers have kept faithful to the old games even if some emulator programmes which allow adaptation across platforms are not always technically quite legal.What is striking is how the rising retro trend has lifted the average gamer age as veterans who got the bug in the 1980s and 1990s pass on their memories and old-time savvy to youngsters, often their own, even as the latter more often than not are coming to the genre via shiny and new hardware.\u201cWe see there is a return to VHS tapes or vinyl and retrogaming is adding itself to that trend \u2014 there\u2019s no reason why video games wouldn\u2019t,\u201d notes Fanny Renard, a community manager at independent studio Goblinz.Given the trend many console makers are retooling their old machines and dusting off catalogues boasting dozens of the hit games of times past.An example is Japanese group Sega, which had found itself unable to stand its ground in the face of new-fangled competition from the likes of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.For retro fans Sega is now proposing its Mega Drive Mini, replete with 42 games.Nintendo has meanwhile revamped its NES and SuperNES consoles while the first edition of PlayStation is also back on the market.\u201cThe fact that each maker is retooling its consoles with sizeable catalogues shows there really is a market out there,\u201d says Laurent Michaud, director of studies for Idate.\u201cThe cost of the retooling is pretty low and has already long been paid off \u2014 it\u2019s just a bit of supplementary layout for these groups,\u201d says Mr. Michaud.How long the business can surf the retro wave is not clear, however. \u201cAugmented reality is the market of the future\u201d for video games. \u201cRetrogaming is a bit different,\u201d Mr. Michaud suggests.\u201cThis has the potential to become a real market, albeit not a very big one and not for very long,\u201d predicts Andrew Kitson, an analyst with Fitch Solutions.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Dozens of young gamers, visiting the stand at the Gamescom convention, flocked to try their hand at the army\u2019s flight simulator or test their reactions on a two-player game.However, the military personnel were careful to spell out the difference between the reality of life in the ranks and violent military-based video games.\u201cWe have a clear educational mission: we strictly try to separate virtual games from reality by explaining to any interested young people that this is not a video game,\u201d Mr. Feldhoff said.If a gamer \u201cwants to become a soldier because he is interested in weapons, that\u2019s not a good argument,\u201d he added.The move is part of an initiative to change the public image of obsolete equipment and under-investment that has plagued the Bundeswehr.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n(Clockwise from top left) Works by Avinash Kharat, Georgy Roy, Arunoday Singh, Sadhika Gupta and Bhavika Malhotra\n\u00a0 The Internet comes with a plethora of opportunities. From making a living out of posting food pictures on Instagram to bringing the most unlikely of ideas to life via 3D printing and virtual reality, it has redefined the meaning of art.But with the change comes the risk of losing traditions that have their own unique charm. Calligraphy is one such, evoking images of masters stooped over their work, from Istanbul to Old Delhi to rural China.Luckily, the tribe is far from gone. A new crop of artists are capitalising on the power of platforms like Instagram to help netizens discover the power of handwriting. Recently, US-based calligrapher, Brenna Jordan, released her book, The Lost Art of Handwriting, to help her readers discover the power of penmanship. Closer home, five local calligraphers are giving the art form their own spin.\n\n\n\n\n\nArunoday Singh, (@sufisoul) | 1,03,000 followers: You might recognise him as the \u2018too-hot-to-handle\u2019 hunk, Dhruv, in the Sonam Kapoor starrer, Aisha, but Singh\u2019s alter-ego lives on Instagram, under the alias \u2018sufisoul\u2019. He\u2019s cautious about labels, however, refusing to call himself a calligrapher. \u201cThat implies being able to write in multiple fonts,\u201d he explains. \u201cI just write in my own handwriting which is rather calligraphic.\u201d The account is the actor\u2019s passion project, and while he hasn\u2019t sold his works yet, he says penning poems from the heart has helped connect with a virtual audience. \u201cThe platform has helped me develop a more minimalist style of poetry,\u201d he adds. \u201cI try to weave a thought as simply as I can. It\u2019s a wonderful challenge that has opened up my mind in a host of ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSadhika Gupta, (@delhidoodler08) | 16,300 followers: Life coming full circle might sound clich\u00e9d, but it is something that Gupta can relate to. Four years ago, it was a post on Instagram that opened her eyes to the beauty of brush calligraphy, propelling her to start experimenting with the art form. \u201cI was drawn to the way it could instantly bring words to life,\u201d she says. Diving in, she found her footing with brush pen and copperplate calligraphy. While the former is \u201cmodern and playful\u201d, the latter sticks to traditional strokes and visuals. She started sharing her creations on her account a year later. It is a venture that has paid off, helping her identify and match with clients such as Reliance Trends. Pro-tip to get noticed on the platform? Use carefully-curated hashtags, she says. Gupta focusses on putting out content that makes her proud. \u201cI often speak about issues like feminism and mental health that are close to my heart, and I try to keep my work positive, relevant, and relatable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBhavika Malhotra, (@theinkaffair) | 4,500 followers: \u201cMy day job involved understanding typography, calligraphy, and fonts,\u201d says Bhavika Malhotra, laughing. Three years ago, she never expected a stint in a digital marketing agency to usher in an obsession with the art form. She latched on to what\u2019s commonly called \u2018the modern calligraphy luxury script style\u2019, even developing her own popular font, Wild Magnolia. She provides services in calligraphy and font design through both her Instagram and Facebook pages. She also conducts workshops in conjunction with outfits like The Craft Sutra. Malhotra credits social media and its vastness with inspiring her. \u201cThe more I see, the more I know, and the more I experiment, from toying with modern script to more whimsical and playful sans serifs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgy Roy, (@gy_roy) | 7,077 followers: Roy\u2019s work in graphic design and motion graphics led him to YouTube videos about calligraphy, an art that he says \u201cbreaks the typographical structure by adding a natural quality to the designs being shown\u201d. With three years of experience under his belt, he sticks primarily to hand-lettering which, quite literally, means drawing letters by hand, giving him more freedom to include different styles in a single composition. What started off as a hobby has become a source of income for the artist, who connects with clients on social media. He also provides hand-lettering for walls \u2014 in homes and public places like restaurants. \u201cIt challenges me to keep innovating,\u201d he adds. His latest trials? Testing out the iPad Pro to create novelties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvinash Kharat, (@avinash_calligraphy) | 23,400 followers: It was an ordinary day at the gym, 10 years ago, when Kharat chanced upon a calligrapher who \u201copened his eyes to the music of [the art]\u201d. \u201cI began with Roman and Gothic styles, and transitioned to copperplate five years later,\u201d he says. \u201cThe latter requires a special tool called an oblique holder.\u201d Equipped with a dipped pen nib, the tool has pointed tines which, when treated with pressure, separate to form a visually-pleasing mixture of thin and thick strokes on paper. He uploads videos of the technique to his social media audience of over 20,000, both on Facebook and Instagram. The strategy has paid off, bringing in deals with clients like Louis Vuitton and Gucci. \u201cMy technique has allowed me to stay unique over the decade,\u201d he says. "

      "\n(Left) Yanchan Rajmohan and Shan Vincent de Paul \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nGajan Balan / @gajanbalan  Last month, Sri Lankan-origin Canadian hip-hop artistes Shan Vincent de Paul and Yanchan Rajmohan sat down to release the first episode of Mrithangam Raps. That 40-second video now stands at close to 6,000 views on Facebook, while the second has close to 90,000. The third and latest episode, which rolled out on August 16, is at over 1.76 lakh views, going viral with comments pouring in from all over the world. Even as more Diaspora Asian voices are coming to the forefront of music and art, de Paul \u2014 a Jaffna-born kid who moved to Canada and grew up on (fellow Sri Lankan) rapper M.I.A\u2019s music \u2014 has two albums out. His new nine-track mixtape, Svdp 2, features the latest number, which combines his tightly-knit delivery with Rajmohan\u2019s galloping speed on the mridangam. The percussionist says, \u201cWhen I produced the beat for the song \u2018I Know\u2019, it had hints of mridangam. We were discussing its live performance when Shan pitched the idea. We then tried it out in the studio, and the rest is history.\u201d  De Paul says he felt this was the right time to test the waters, adding, \u201cI think a part of me knew it would take off \u2014 rapping in English makes it a bit more intriguing and unexpected.\u201d And what of the Facebook comments that say the instrument shouldn\u2019t be used in conjunction with swearing? He dismisses these naysayers, as he feels the idea of \u201cbad words\u201d is antiquated. Besides, he says, \u201cRap is a powerful art form because it is inherently raw, honest and political by nature. I may use \u2018crass\u2019 language at times, because that is an expression of how I feel and who I am.\u201d As for the divinity of the mridangam, he observes that it is man-made, and simply attributed with symbolic value. Both artistes accept that it is tough to convert this viral internet fame into loyal listeners \u2014 Mrithangam Raps might get curious appreciation, but it may not get people tuned into Svdp 2 or Rajmohan\u2019s work. \u201cThe episodes are a testament to our skill set, above anything else,\u201d says de Paul.

      "\n\nFive reasons to unfollow Instagram influencers \n",
      "Updated: August 23, 2019 15:16 IST\rPublished: August 23, 2019 15:16 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/five-reasons-to-unfollow-instagram-influencers/article29231865.ece",
      "\nSince influencer fatigue doesn\u2019t have to go on, at least not on your personal feed, here are five reasons to hit unfollow on Instagram\n\u00a0 Influencer fatigue is real \u2014 and I am proof. Indian fashion influencers were once fun, relatable and original, but after religiously following their content over the years, I\u2019ve cleansed my feed now because I\u2019ve had enough. \u201cInfluencer marketing is usually outsourced to an agency,\u2019\u2019 says Naina Redhu (@naina on Instagram and Twitter), one of the pioneers of the fashion blogging scene in India. \u201cFor most agencies, sponsorships and collaborations are just a number play. There\u2019s no long-term thought process or strategy.\u201dRedhu, who runs her own brand building workshops, is one of the very few influencers who is vocal about the deterioration of fashion content on social media and the lackadaisical attitudes of digital agencies when it comes to working with influencers. \u201cI can say no to campaigns,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter because even if I don\u2019t, someone else will. And it will go on and on and on.\u201dSince it doesn\u2019t have to go on, at least not on your personal feed, here are five reasons to unfollow influencers:1. Insipid and irrelevant The style advice that Indian fashion influencers are giving out today is either incredibly boring, like \u20185 Ways to Wear Jeans\u2019 (an actual video that someone put out recently), or impossible to execute in real life. Wearing a blazer without a shirt might be great for the \u2019gram, but not for the office.2. Cloned captions, corporate content Perhaps what really pushed me over the edge is the sea of identical sponsored posts with captions that are right out of the brand\u2019s corporate communications playbook. Only recently, a number of influencers posted long, sentimental captions with family memories only to end them with how a diamond jewellery brand was the centerpiece of what was otherwise a very intimate memory. 3. When sponsored posts are too manySponsorship, in many ways, has taken over the authenticity that was once the influencer\u2019s calling card. Many aren\u2019t transparent about their sponsored content either. While it is understandable that this is the business model and they are vital to sustain one\u2019s career, paid posts are a lot like TV ads. If I see more ads than actual programming, I am most definitely going to change the channel.4. Research not a priorityIt is evident that while many brands are enthusiastic about working with influencers, they do little, if not zero, research about their profile, and vice versa. Case in point, an online luxury marketplace that was heavily promoted by influencers, recently shut down its page after paying customers exposed the site for heavy delays and, at times, fake goods. 5. Influencers aren\u2019t influentialInfluencers were imagined to be that cool friend we all adored and trusted for their views and opinions. Today, they\u2019re more of an annoying acquaintance. Maybe in real life, we\u2019d be forced to listen to them go on and on about their fabulous all-expenses-paid vacation, the sponsored chocolate that they\u2019ll be feeding their brother during Raksha Bandhan, and the designer clothes they were able to buy from the money they earned promoting a toothpaste they don\u2019t use. But thankfully, this isn\u2019t real life and the unfollow button may be the best thing that ever happened to your Instagram feed.Lavanya Mohan is a social media junkie who manages growth and fashion partnerships at Vue.ai, an AI platform for retailYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA 3D printed Android mascot Bugdroid is seen in front of a Google logo in this illustration taken July 9, 2017. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n Google, on Thursday, finally announced the name of their next Android version, pulling one over on those of us who were wondering what dessert name began with Q.Android Q, as it was affectionately called, is now officially Android 10. The build comes with a new logo and new font, but there are also several upgrades, tweaks and new features that come along with it.Here are some of them.Android 10 lets you change your phone\u2019s theme to \u2018Dark\u2019, both in the system\u2019s UI and the apps. The dark mode also helps with the phone\u2019s battery life, as it requires significantly less power. You can also change the theme of an app separately when it is running.You might not need a password to connect to WiFi anymore. A QR code will suffice. Dubbed \u2018Easy Connect\u2019, the new system lets you create a QR code that others can use to access your WiFi.Android 10 lets two apps on your phone record or listen to audio at the same time. \u201cBefore Android Q the input audio stream could only be captured by one app at a time,\u201d Google writes in their developers\u2019 forum. \"Once an app started to capture audio, all other apps had no way to access the audio input until the capturing app stopped.\u201dBut now, you might be able to get two applications listen to audio input at the same time. For instance, you could, depending on privacy settings and permissions, use the voice recorder app while also speaking to Google assistant.In addition, the upgrade also has something called the AudioPlaybackCapture API (Application Programming Interface), which lets you capture audio from another app that is playing. This used to be a feature restricted to video, but now there is an audio option as well.The Thermal API lets apps know the state of the chipsets and processors in the phone. If the apps detect that the phone has warmed up, they can make changes to how they function in order to bring the temperature down and restore optimum performance. \u201cWhen the device reports thermal stress, apps and games can help by backing off ongoing activities to reduce power usage on various ways,\u201d Google says.You might not have to jump through multiple pages to get to the phone settings you want. Settings Panels lets you access phone settings that are contextual to the app that you currently have open.For example, if you\u2019re on Chrome and there\u2019s no connectivity, Chrome will automatically open the Connectivity settings panel on your page, instead of you having to juggle the Chrome and the Settings app to get what you want.Bubbles are notifications \u2018bubbles\u2019 that will now pop up on your screen, even when you are using other applications. They are designed for multitasking, but the feature can also be turned off if you don\u2019t like it.Android 10 has new permissions access that \u201cgives users more control over app access to device location\u201d, according to Google. You can tweak location permissions in such a way that an app can access your location only when the app is being used. That is, the app cannot access it when it is running in background.There are several tweaks to privacy controls, one of the foremost being that apps cannot launch by themselves. Now, applications need a user\u2019s permission to launch, as opposed to when apps could automatically launch without user interaction.Android 10 also restricts apps from accessing the contents of the phone\u2019s screen. Any apps that need to access the phone screen will now need additional, on-the-go permission.There are several foldable phones out there in the market -- Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold, Huawei\u2019s Mate X and more. Android 10 offers support for application developers to develop apps specifically for such devices, even with different folding patterns. The support addresses the app\u2019s resizing, screen ratios, multi window functions, display cutouts and more.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " Breaking the 10-year history of naming Android releases after desserts, Google on Thursday announced it had officially named the next version as just Android 10.\u201cFirst, we\u2019re changing the way we name our releases. Our engineering team has always used internal code names for each version, based of tasty treats, or desserts, in alphabetical order,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android, in a statement.The naming tradition has become a fun part of the release each year externally too, like Android Lollipop or Marshmallows.\u201cAs a global operating system, it\u2019s important that these names are clear and relatable for everyone in the world. So, this next release of Android will simply use the version number and be called Android 10,\u201d Mr. Samat explained.\u201cWhile there were many tempting \u2018Q\u2019 desserts out there, we think that at version 10 and 2.5 billion active devices, it was time to make this change,\u201d he added.Now, this year is Android 10 and next year will be Android 11, and so on.Google also changed the logo from green to black.It\u2019s a small change but Google found the green was hard to read, especially for people with visual impairments. Google will officially start using the updated logo in the coming weeks with the final release of Android 10.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Updated: August 21, 2019 13:57 IST\rPublished: August 21, 2019 13:57 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/this-wearable-uses-sweat-to-give-real-time-health-updates/article29197360.ece",
      "Researchers, including the Indian-origin study lead author Mallika Bariya, have developed wearable skin sensors that use sweat to provide real-time updates on health problems such as dehydration or fatigue.They used the sensors to monitor the sweat rate, electrolytes and metabolites in sweat, from volunteers who were exercising and others who were experiencing chemically induced perspiration. \u201cThe goal of the project is not just to make the sensors but to study what sweat tells us. For that we need sensors that are reliable, reproducible and that we can fabricate to scale so that we can put multiple sensors in different spots of the body and put them on many subjects,\u201d said Ali Javey, Professor at the University of California.The new sensor design can be rapidly manufactured using a \u2018roll-to-roll\u2019 processing technique that essentially prints the sensors onto a sheet of plastic like words on a newspaper. Roll-to-roll processing enables high-volume production of disposable patches at low cost. The sensors contain a spiralling microscopic tube that wicks sweat from the skin. By tracking how fast the sweat moves through the microfluidic, the sensors can report how much a person is sweating. To better understand what sweat can say about the real-time health of the human body, the researchers first placed the sweat sensors on different spots on volunteers\u2019 bodies and measured their sweat rates, and sodium and potassium levels in their sweat while they exercised. They found that the sweat rate could indicate the body\u2019s overall liquid loss during exercise, meaning that tracking sweat rate might be a way to give athletes a heads up, when they may be pushing themselves too hard. They also used the sensors to compare sweat glucose levels and blood glucose levels in healthy and diabetic patients, and found that a single sweat glucose measurement cannot indicate a person\u2019s blood glucose level. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of hope that non-invasive sweat tests could replace blood-based measurements for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes, but we\u2019ve shown that there isn\u2019t a simple, universal correlation between sweat and blood glucose levels,\u201d said Mallika.

      "\nThe case was brought by a German consumer protection agency against an online clothes site that embeds a Facebook button to encourage shoppers to publicise its wares\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n  Soon, you could get fewer familiar ads following you around the internet \u2014 or at least on Facebook.Facebook is launching a long-promised tool that lets you limit what the social network can gather about you on outside websites and apps. The company said on Tuesday that it is adding a section where you can see the activity that Facebook tracks outside its service via its \u201clike\u201d buttons and other means. You can choose to turn off the tracking; otherwise, tracking will continue the same way it has been.Formerly known as \u201cclear history,\u201d the tool will now go by the slightly clunkier moniker \u201coff-Facebook activity.\u201d The feature launches in South Korea, Ireland and Spain on Tuesday, consistent with Facebook\u2019s tendency to launch features in smaller markets first. The company did not give a timeline for when it might expand it to the U.S. and other countries, only that it will be in \u201ccoming months.\u201d What you do off Facebook is among the many pieces of information that Facebook uses to target ads to people. Blocking the tracking could mean fewer ads that seem familiar \u2014 for example, for a pair of shoes you decided not to buy, or a nonprofit you donated money to.But it won\u2019t change the actual number of ads you\u2019ll see on Facebook. Nor will it change how your actions on Facebook are used to show you ads. Even if you turn off tracking, Facebook will still gather data on your off-Facebook activities. It will simply disconnect those activities from your Facebook profile. Facebook says businesses won\u2019t know you clicked on their ad \u2014 but they\u2019ll know that someone did. So Facebook can still tell advertisers how well their ads are performing. Jasmine Enberg, social media analyst at research firm eMarketer, said the tool is part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to be clearer to users on how it tracks them and likely \u201can effort to stay one step ahead of regulators, in the U.S. and abroad.\u201d Facebook faces increasing governmental scrutiny over its privacy practices, including a record $5 billion fine from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for mishandling user data. Boosting its privacy protections could help the company pre-empt regulation and further punishment. But it\u2019s a delicate dance, as Facebook still depends on highly targeted advertising for nearly all of its revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the \u201cclear history\u201d feature more than a year ago. The company said building it has been a complicated technical process, which is also the reason for the slow, gradual rollout. Facebook said it sought input from users, privacy experts and policymakers along the way, which led to some changes. For instance, users will be able to disconnect their activity from a specific websites or apps, or reconnect to a specific site while keeping other future tracking turned off. You\u2019ll be able to access the feature by going to your Facebook settings and scrolling down to \u201cyour Facebook information.\u201d The \u201coff-Facebook activity\u201d section will be there when it launches. The tool will let you delete your past browsing history from Facebook and prevent it from keeping track of your future clicks, taps and website visits going forward. Doing so means that Facebook won\u2019t use information gleaned from apps and websites to target ads to you on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. It also won\u2019t use such information to show you posts that Facebook thinks you might like based on your offsite activity, such as news articles shared by your friends. Stephanie Max, product manager at Facebook, said the company believes the tool could affect revenue, though she didn\u2019t say how much. But she said giving people \u201ctransparency and control\u201d is important. Enberg, the eMarketer analyst, said the ultimate impact \u201cdepends on consumer adoption. It takes a proactive step for consumers to go into their Facebook settings and turn on the feature.\u201d People who say they value privacy often don\u2019t actually do anything about it, she said, so it\u2019s possible too few people will use this tool to have a meaningful effect on Facebook\u2019s bottom line.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nFirst impressions of the Samsung Galaxy Note10 and Note10+\n\n",
      "Updated: August 20, 2019 20:47 IST\rPublished: August 20, 2019 19:48 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/first-impressions-of-the-samsung-galaxy-note10-and-note10/article29182741.ece",
      "At first glance, the Samsung Note10 resembles a holographic dream \u2013 and a pricey one at that. Today in India, the hype around one of this year's most anticipated smartphones reached a peak with the launch of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note10 and Galaxy Note10+. This is the first time a single Galaxy phone is offered in two models from which to choose.\u00a0\u00a0Pegged as the smartphone for the millennial creative professional, the latest edition promises to keep up with the reputation of the Galaxy series in regards to excess and fervour.\u00a0\u00a0At the launch event in Bengaluru, HC Hong, president and CEO of Samsung Southwest Asia, stated, \u201cGalaxy Note fans in India are most loyal. They love the Galaxy Note for the infinite possibilities it offers with its big screen, unique S Pen and multitasking capabilities. With the launch of Galaxy Note10, we are creating a new era of mobile productivity for a generation that believes in doing more in life, by choice. The new devices will appeal to millennials with their sleek design, stunning colours and power-packed features that will keep them going all day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The design has switched up for the Note10 series; the dimensions are boxier with an almost non-existent bevel because clean lines are the new black! Samsung claims this upgraded design is purposeful and \u201csleek, slim and distraction-free\u201d.\u00a0 \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung eyes 65% market share as it unveils Note 10, Note 10+ \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSamsung eyes 65% market share as it unveils Note 10, Note 10+ There\u2019s a notable upgrade in the physical design for the Note10 series; the edge-to-edge design\u00a0comprises the intuitive and crisp Cinematic Infinity Display is nearly bezel-less, while the in-display cut out for the front camera is small and centred for a balanced design \u2013 all ideal for gamers, graphic designers and writing professionals.\u00a0\u00a0With this, an upgraded display is very much required to keep things competitive: think award-winning Dynamic AMOLED display, complete with HDR10+ certification and Dynamic Tone Mapping for more vibrant photos and videos. And, of course, moderation is key as the device\u2019s Eye Comfort display reduces blue light (known to increase the risk of macular degeneration) without affecting colour quality for comfortable viewing.\u00a0So the big question: how\u2019s the camera? This is often the deciding factor for many Indian buyers. Go wide for a 123\u00b0 field of vision with the 16MP Ultra Wide Camera, or crop in with the 12MP Wide-angle Camera, or get closer with 2x optical zoom on the 12MP Telephoto Camera. The Wide-angle camera auto-adjusts to the surrounding light: F1.5 mode brings light into dark scenes, F2.4 mode keeps things sharp in bright daylight, and Night Mode brightens up super low light scenes.\u00a0The camera in the Note10 also promises movie-grade video tech complete with live-focus, Zoom-In Mic (which amplifies the audio in the frame and pushes background noise aside to help focus on the sounds that you want) and a Super Steady stabiliser which is ideal for hyperlapses.\u00a0\u00a0The AR Doodle and 3D Scanner are an exciting addition, especially for graphic designers and animators. The 3D Scanner has the Galaxy Note10+\u2019s Depth Vision camera taking a scan of an object and instantly turning it into a movable 3D rendering.\u00a0\u00a0Other camera specs include a Night Mode for low-light environments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We know the Galaxy Note9 familiarised us with the wonders of the brand\u2019s stylus S Pen, but the Galaxy Note10 builds on the Bluetooth Low Energy-enabled S Pen capabilities sensor by adding Air actions, with new six-axis motion allowing you to control certain aspects of the device using gestures with the S Pen by detecting the direction and acceleration of your movements. By opening up the Air actions SDK, developers can create customized controls that give users the ability to play games or use their favourite applications using gestures.\u00a0To keep the young professionals \u2013 who are just that used to switching between devices \u2013 hooked, the Galaxy Note10 integrates a \u2018Link to Windows\u2019 function directly into the Quick Panel. So, with one click, users can connect to their Windows 10 PC and they can see notifications, send and receive messages, and review recent photos without pausing to look down at their phone\u2026 and it\u2019s not just your notifications that you can mirror; you can also mirror your entire phone screen on-to your PC. \u00a0Display: Note10 is a 6.3-inch FHD+ while the Note10+ is 6.8-inch Quad HD+Rear camera: Note10 is a Triple Camera while the Note10+ is a Quad CameraBattery: Note10\u2019s capacity is 3,500mAh while the Note10+ has 4,300mAh\u00a0Galaxy Note10+ will be available starting \u20b979,999, while Galaxy Note10 is priced at \u20b969,999. Galaxy Note10+ will be available in two variants \u2013 12GB RAM + 256GB memory and 12GB RAM + 512GB memory.\u00a0With a Micro SD card, consumers can add additional 1TB storage to the Galaxy Note10+.

      "\n\nKhaja Moinuddin's no-frills cooking on \u2018Nawab\u2019s Kitchen\u2019 helps feed orphans\n\n",
      "Updated: August 21, 2019 14:10 IST\rPublished: August 20, 2019 16:15 IST",

      "If you are able to look away from Khaja Moinuddin\u2019s ear-to-ear grin, you will notice a 40 kilogram-capacity degcha or a handi that is either resting over a bed of embers or bubbling with food in the heat of a wood fire. His kitchen is always outdoors; Moinuddin is either cooking in the open under the sky or, during the summer months, under the shade of a tree. His smile remains intact, no matter where.Moinuddin\u2019s cooking is on a big scale, similar to his boundless smile. And if you are one of those who gets sucked into the web of cooking demo video feeds, then you are sure to have come across his.If Moinuddin\u2019s name doesn\u2019t strike a bell, the YouTube channel Nawab\u2019s Kitchen sure will. Popular as one of the viral content creators from Hyderabad, the chef is almost always cooking to be able to feed 40 people. The cooked food is distributed in orphanages and their staff, as well as among people who stop by and wait patiently to watch him cook.\u201cI always cook extra and never come back with leftovers. Once we are done cooking, everyone in and around the area where we cook is free to join us to eat. Initially we would pack the cooked food in boxes and distribute it, then we thought we would feel even better if we are able to serve the people directly,\u201d says Moinuddin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd who is the \u2018we\u2019 he is referring to? Moinuddin clarifies he might be the face of Nawab\u2019s Kitchen, but there are two others who work equally hard to put every video on YouTube. \u201cMy colleagues-turned-friends Srinath Reddy and Bhagat Reddy are with me in this. We conceptualised Nawab\u2019s Kitchen (NK) together,\u201d smiles Moinuddin.Moinuddin has over 10 years of working experience in regional TV channels as a producer. His friends and partners Srinath and Bhagat who prefer to work behind the scenes are experienced at working in the video editing department. Having known each other for a good number of years, the three decided to quit their jobs and start a YouTube channel that will engage, educate and be on a neutral topic like food. \u201cThere are very few people who don\u2019t pause while scrolling, to watch a video on how a certain dish is being cooked. Especially if it is an dish Indian, and been shot to show the richness of rustic regional cuisine,\u201d adds Moinuddin.NK\u2019s no-frill videos and a relaxed explanation of the ingredients and cooking process, wins him fans on his YouTube channel. His recipes are easy and simple to follow. \u201cHowever, we choose a venue to cook that is close to some orphanage so that we can share the food with them. When we set out to put together NK we wanted to do social service through what we were gaining,\u201d adds Moinuddin. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0None of the three friends are trained chefs, they function with the knowledge and experience that comes with observing their families cook. Moinuddin adds, \u201cMy nani was an excellent cook, when I was in Tenali with her while doing my graduation, I learnt her style of cooking.\u201dFor dishes like pizza and cakes, Moinuddin equips himself by learning online. \u201cWhen we reach the gates of the orphanages, the smile and love with which the children greets us, banishes the day\u2019s stress. The love and appreciation they show towards us makes us wonder where the children get their wisdom from,\u201d says Moinuddin. NK regularly visits about 15 orphanages to share their food.What is Nawab Kitchen\u2019s signature dish? \u201cMy mutton biryani has a lot of fans,\u201d he laughs.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHow Cosmos-Maya integrates technology and storytelling \n",
      "Updated: August 20, 2019 15:44 IST\rPublished: August 20, 2019 15:44 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-does-cosmos-maya-work/article29181138.ece",
      "\nCosmos-Maya has positioned itself as one of the pioneers in the field of animation in India \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  A nine-year-old Ankush\u2019s life changes when he meets a mysterious character called Bajrangi, modelled after the Indian God Hanuman. Bajrangi not only helps Ankush deal with his inner fears, but also teaches him life lessons. This is the premise of the animated series Selfie with Bajrangi, whose quintessential \u2018Indianness\u2019 may look preposterous on paper, but has achieved popularity among children. The show runners are Cosmos-Maya, best known for creating the animated sitcom Motu Patlu, the Indian Laurel and Hardy.What started as a service studio in 1996 has grown into becoming one of the leading animators in the country. Since 2012, Cosmos-Maya became an Intellectual Property (IP) creation company with over 14 shows and 2,000-plus episodes. What explains the company\u2019s longevity? Over an email interview, Anish Mehta, CEO of Cosmos-Maya, attributes the success to the evolving business model. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnish Mehta, CEO of Cosmos-Maya \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cFresh content is a great contributory factor here. Novelty and relatability are two aspects you will find in all our IPs. Our shows air in more than 150 countries worldwide. The latest and biggest evolutionary leap is our entry into third-party distribution, which we are aggressively pursuing.\u201d Secrets of an illusionistAnish Mehta believes that \u201cinternational co-productions are the way forward\u201d. Cosmos-Maya currently has four Italian co-productions including Leo Da Vinci, Berry Bees, an Italian-Australian-Irish co-production, OPS and Atchoo!.The company has tied up with Studio 100 France for the upcoming Galactic Agency.WowKidz, according to Anish, has registered over 12 billion views, giving us a picture about the company\u2019s digital penetration.From a business perspective, what determines the success of series like Selfie with Bajrangior Guddu? Is it the programming strategy or the numbers with which they gauge their target audience? The secret sauce, according to Anish, is \u201cthe ability to speak to viewers in the universal language of relatability\u201d. He goes on to add: \u201cIn a world where success is determined by rating points, I believe that success depends on the impact that the show leaves on the audience.\u201d In terms of the investment for an average animated series, Anish says that the scale is much lesser in India compared to other Asian markets like Korea and China. Without getting into actual numbers, he adds that the cost is anywhere between US$1.5- 2.5 million for 52 X 11 episodes.The Indian animation industry operates in a restricted environment (read: kid-friendly content) and the market is plagued by its need to cater to children \u2014 arguably the reason why we are light years away from producing a high-concept animated series like Netflix\u2019s BoJack Horseman, which has a reasonably good fan following among Indian millennials. Anish says that Cosmos-Maya has managed to identify this alarming gap and senses a potential opportunity, thanks to the influence of Hollywood movies, the opening of digital market and the audience\u2019s maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from Inspector Chingum\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nThere are several untapped markets in the country, he agrees. One such being cinema. Scores of independent VFX companies have been working closely with major studios in Hollywood. Yet, Indian cinema hasn\u2019t produced a single memorable animated feature which indicates the lack of fresh content in Indian cinema. It is also partly because the animation industry continues to depend on mythology for formidable narratives. In fact, Cosmos-Maya\u2019s feature film Motu Patlu: King of Kings did not do well unlike as opposed to its cartoon series. If this poses a threat to the animation industry, how do they overcome it? Anish says, \u201cStorytelling is evolving and Baahubali has proved it. It\u2019s a matter of time for animation to get there.\u201dCosmos-Maya gained a strong digital presence with WowKidz, an umbrella channel consisting of over 30 animated programmes with over 25 million subscriptions so far. Anish Mehta observes that there is a significant change in the consumption pattern of the audience, thanks to the emerging popularity of large-scale, video-on-demand services. With regards to the rising production quality on streaming services he elaborates, \u201cThis bodes well for content creators as there will be more touchpoints for the final consumer to reach our library... People are now more open to linear kind of stories and the length of the show is not that big a restriction.\u201dCosmos-Maya also has plans to exploit the potential of Virtual Reality, which is gradually seeping into the animation industry. But right now, Anish Mehta is optimistic about its future impact, \u201cWe will be foraying into VR soon. The business for VR in India is being analysed and the current trends paint a good picture.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\niNethra team members D. Neelima and K. Bhavya Sri with the prototype of the eye screening device at T-Hub on Monday.\n\u00a0 A team of four engineering students from a college affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad, has developed a device and mobile app to make vision screening easy, accessible and affordable too.iNethra, the product, comprises a handy, stick-like device with a lens on one end and connected to a smart phone camera on the other side. While this helps in clicking the retinal image of the patients, the mobile app helps in sharing and receiving information related to the eye condition. The clicked images are uploaded to the app for the doctor to access and analyse them. There is a provision in the app for the doctor to note details about the eye condition, provide tips and if required refer them to hospitals, said K. Bhavya Sri and D. Neelima, two members who received a certificate on behalf of the team for participating in 2019 national cohort of the Boeing University Innovation Leadership Development programme.The certificate, presented to them by IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan at an event in T-Hub on Monday, said they have successfully completed the regional level workshop held earlier this month at T-Hub Foundation. M. Srija and D. Sai Sowmya are the other members. Aiding them was J-Hub, the incubator at JNTU, by way of mentoring, shaping their idea and business plan and making connections with doctors, according to Ms. Bhavya Sri. On the way forward, Ms. Neelima said with the prototype in hand, the team looked forward to getting funds to take the project forward and simultaneously improvise the device and cut down the costs. Initially, the plan is to pursue a B2B (business-to-business) model under which partner eye clinics would approach patients coming to public health centres.Mr. Ranjan, who is also officiating as Vice-Chancellor of JNTU, told the Entrepreneurship Day celebrations at T-Hub how Hyderabad boasts of a strong start-up eco-system, including the high quality J-Hub incubator. The affiliated colleges of JNTU too have set up their own incubator and with J-Hub connected on a hub and spoke model. Tracing the growth of the \u201cvibrant and dynamic innovation eco-system\u201d of Hyderabad and the emergence of T-Hub, the senior official said a lot has changed including the mindset of people towards start-up and entrepreneurship.

      "\n\nDetecting cardiovascular diseases may get easier soon, courtesy researchers at IIT-H\n\n",
      "Updated: August 20, 2019 07:41 IST\rPublished: August 20, 2019 00:13 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/detecting-cardiovascular-diseases-may-get-easier-soon/article29164338.ece",
      "The researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), have collaborated with research institutions across the world to develop a device to detect heart diseases in minutes. In a work published recently in the peer-reviewed Journal of Materials Chemistry B, they say their work not only promises diagnosis or prediction of heart disorders within minutes, but can also be extended to detection of other diseases.Headed by Renu John, head of Department of Biomedical Engineering, IIT-H, the research team says clinical complications of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are at present the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Primary and specialist health-providers use a variety of tools for clinical assessment of the existing heart diseases and to identify vulnerable patients at risk for CVD. Biosensors are one such tools. Prof. Renu John\u2019s studies on microfluidics would help in building biomarker-based biosensors that could be used for instantaneous detection of heart attack and other cardiac diseases.\u201cBiomarkers are biological molecules that represent health and disease states. They are specific chemicals that are released in the body in response to certain physiological conditions. Cardiac troponins or cTns, for instance, are biomarkers of heart diseases and are conventionally detected in the blood stream using antibodies that bind specifically to them. Biosensors are devices that combine the sensing element (the antibody) with a transducer that converts the interaction of antibody into electrical or optical signal that can be measured. Conventional biosensing includes such techniques as ELISA, chemiluminescent immunoassay and radioimmunoassay,\u201d said Prof. Renu John. B.D. Malhotra from Delhi Technological University said, \u201cThe major issue with the conventional assays for the detection of cTns relates to poor sensitivity and limitations in detection. Improvements in detecting biosensors such as cTns in blood require improvements in the design of the biosensor\u201d.Prof. Malhotra believes that the technique can be extended to other diseases as well by varying the type of biomarker/antibody that is attached to the nanospheres. Thus, microfluidics-based biosensing offers new opportunities in the areas of biological engineering, biomedical studies, point-of-care diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.Prof. Renu John\u2019s team and collaborators from IIT-Kanpur, Zoological Survey of India, Iowa State University and Delhi Technological University, used hollow nickel vanadate nanospheres, modified with chitosan and loaded with antibodies of cTns in a microfluidic set-up. When blood containing the CVD biomarker cTns passed through the biofluidic set-up loaded with biosensing nanospheres, cTns binds with the antibody and induces an electrical signal in the nanosphere, which is then detected.Prof. Renu John and his team tested the performance of the microfluidic biosensors using blood serum of cardiac patients and compared the results with those of conventional chemiluminescence assays. They found that the microfluidic devices could detect the CVD biomarker cTns with extremely high degree of accuracy and sensitivity. cTns levels as low as 0.000000000005 grams in one millilitre of blood could be detected, which makes this technique a useful tool for detection of cardiovascular maladies, they say.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "The Fire Emblem series is one of the finest turn-based strategy games. For ages, it has been living on Nintendo\u2019s 3DS handhelds. For the first time in 12 years, the series is coming to Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console. Fire Emblem can now be experienced in your living room and on the go. The latest game in the series, Three Houses, is very addictive. Fire Emblem Nintendo is famous for Mario and Donkey Kong, but they also have other franchises that are long running. Fire Emblem is one of them. It was only available in Japan for a long time. But the game has become increasingly popular in the west, as it offers deep storylines, turn-based strategy mechanics and some devious battles.The prestigious Church of Seiros is the only thing maintaining peace between three previously warring nations in the land of Fodlan. You play a mercenary named Byleth who saves three nobles, each a representative of a powerful house in the Officers Academy of Garreg Mach Monastery. After the heroic rescue, you find yourself becoming a teacher in the Academy, which has three houses (a la Harry Potter): the Black Eagles, the Golden Deer and the Blue Lions. As professor, apart from teaching, you also play the role of a commander, to lead your house to glory. The story, which explores the deadly politics (not Game of Thrones-level though) between the powerful nations, is intriguing. \n\n\n\n\n\nFire Emblem also has \u2018Permadeath\u2019, a feature that disables the character from respawning \u2014 if you die, you die. You could avoid this in the casual mode. Additionally, there\u2019s an undo feature, Divine Pulse, wherein you can rewind a few turns. Fire Emblem: Three Houses Developer: Intelligent Systems, Koei Tecmo GamesPublisher: Nintendo Price: \u20b94000 Approx ($59.99) for Nintendo SwitchThe turn-based strategy game is challenging, even if you discount permadeath. You control battalions on a map led by units and position them on a chessboard-like grid. Attacks play out in glorious detail on a 3D plane, once you unleash Combat Arts your students learn at the school. The most fun aspect of the game is the school social simulator, which reminds you of Hogwarts. As a teacher, the game consistently reminds you that slacking off will lead to untrained soldiers on the field. On Sundays in the game, you\u2019re free to relax in many ways, which includes romancing a character (it can lead to an in-game marriage). No matter how you choose to spend your days, it\u2019s always about building strong relationships with your students and training them to be the best. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a Nintendo Switch and want something deep to jump into, the Fire Emblem: Three Houses is excellent. With its Hogwarts-like setting and excellent turn-based combat, the game will keep you engaged.

      "\n\nBBC special \u2018Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side\u2019 asks what makes social media and technology addictive\n\n",

      "So, you have posted your latest achievement on social media. Within minutes, your phone buzzes with notifications. You click immediately to excitedly see how many likes and retweets you have received... and now you\u2019re hooked. Social media addiction has become a \u2018second nature affliction\u2019 to most of us \u2014 so much so, that there are rehabilitation programmes for it. But what propels this addiction? As part of BBC\u2019s long-running Panorama specials, Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side is soon to be aired on Sony BBC Earth. It is hosted by journalist Hilary Andersson who gets to the bottom of this ongoing social dilemma. In a phone interview, the show\u2019s executive producer Diana Martin provides an insight into how habit-forming technologies have got us hooked onto our phones and what the implications are.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts:How did the idea for the show come about? We were interested in doing something more general on social media and smartphones because they have completely changed our behaviour in the last 20 years and a couple of us on the programme have also got children. Hilary and I are acutely aware how glued our children are to their phones and other devices.Social media always seems to be addictive, but we couldn\u2019t get an answer as to whether it was really addictive and what we should do about it as parents. So we set out researching the nature of our phones and apps that have changed our behaviour, and we wanted to ask whether the social media companies were aware of what they were doing.Are these habit-forming technologies deliberate? The techniques we looked at were the endless scrolling and the \u2018like\u2019 button. Scrolling wasn\u2019t always the case when social media first existed. When search engines first existed, you would get a page of results and then you would have to click to get to the second page. But now when you are scrolling, you don\u2019t have to click. And what we looked into was whether that made you keep reading more. These days, scrolling seems obvious, but is central to all social media.Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side shows how it is like having an endless bowl of soup. If you drink a bowl of soup, you get to the bottom of the bowl and you are finished. But if it is endless, then people would eat more and they would probably eat more than they need. And then, the \u2018like\u2019 button was invented. The \u2018like\u2019 button is now ubiquitous and is cluing into our human behaviour. If you get a \u2018like\u2019, you are more hooked onto it. We talked to Justin Rosenstein, who is the co-founder of Asana, who invented the \u2018like\u2019 button for Facebook. We spoke to psychologists who showed us how similar social media addiction was to what we see in casinos to encourage people to gamble.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there anything we have lost permanently in terms of human interaction? Has it changed the way we make choices?  We were careful not to criticise smartphones or social media. We all have smartphones. They massively help us with our work and to communicate with our family and friends. However, the point here is there are advantages, but there are also disadvantages. Social media is potentially habit forming or addictive in nature. So we did a lot of work into asking whether they are addictive. Scientists were divided on this. Some said they are addictive, but some said they are not really addictive, but they are clearly habit forming. We are reporting the story as we saw it. What we hope to do is help viewers understand a bit more about the possible impact of social media and smartphones on their behaviour. They need to consider their approach and to be a bit more mindful next time they endlessly scroll or the next time they hit the \u2018like\u2019 button.What about the impact of social media on politicians and has it changed how we make political choices? There is a lot more to explore in that area. Clearly, politicians and political parties have had to respond to the rise of social media and different parties have responded in different ways and some have made a certain use of it than others. There is an interesting story on how authoritarian governments are using social media not just for election campaigns but also to control populations, and though the show isn\u2019t about that, I think it is a really interesting issue.What were the challenges in putting together \u2018Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side\u2019? It was very important for us to be impartial. We are the BBC and we have a duty towards impartiality. So the first thing is to make sure that we cover all sides of the argument. We spoke to various people who criticised the manipulation of social media companies. But we also made sure we spoke to people from Facebook who defended the position. And we spoke to a man who develops social media apps who maintained that social media is good for mental health and well-being. The second challenge is that we are not scientists, and it is an area where science hasn\u2019t really come to a comprehensive answer yet, and so we spoke to two psychologists, but there are other scientists who have other views. And it is early days. We had to reflect that as well so that we were not oversimplifying things.\u2018Smartphones \u2014 The Dark Side\u2019 will premiere on Sony BBC Earth on August 31, at 9 pm.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "A 400-year-old temple in Japan is attempting to hot-wire interest in Buddhism with a robotic priest. The android Kannon, based on the Buddhist deity of mercy, preaches sermons at Kodaiji temple in Kyoto, and its human colleagues predict that with artificial intelligence (AI), it could one day acquire unlimited wisdom.The adult-sized robot was put into service earlier this year and is able to move its torso, arms and head. But only its hands, face and shoulders are covered in silicone to replicate human skin."

      "Updated: August 19, 2019 16:19 IST\rPublished: August 19, 2019 15:49 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-a-dutch-filmmaker-shot-an-indian-documentary-on-his-iphone/article29143234.ece",
      "\u2018In India, there\u2019s enough space for everyone\u2019s dreams\u2019. These were the first words Andreas van de Laar was told by an Indian woman as he got on his flight to New Delhi from Amsterdam in 2017. All set to shoot an ambitious documentary on India\u2019s development across sectors, little did he know what the next year had in store for him. \u201cI was planning a big crew and funding but that never came through. A friend had gifted me a smartphone stabiliser/gimbal before I left to India and I felt that was going to be it. A one-man army with a phone,\u201d says Andreas, adding, \u201cIf not for that, I would have gone back home.\u201d Thus began the journey to One Point Seven \u2014 highlighting India\u2019s 1.7 billion citizens and their role in governing the growing democracy \u2014 that releases on October 17 on Andreas\u2019s YouTube channel.Cut to the five-part documentary\u2019s second episode \u2014 aptly titled The Urban Debate \u2014 and it begins with a rather important statistic: By 2035, 17 of the 20 fastest growing cities in the world will be in India, with a few having populations larger than most countries. So, how do we effectively govern them? Such crucial questions are answered in the Dutch filmmaker\u2019s series inspired by Jugaad Innovation, a book that highlights frugal and flexible approach to innovation for the 21st Century. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI came across the book on a backpacking trip to India in 2016 and realised that just having a perspective doesn\u2019t count. In order to solve problems, you have to understand them. Every country develops in its own way and we come from this US-centric vision of how the world should be. I wanted to highlight topics that were under exposed and I was curious how India would innovate and develop. The people in the film are doing really important stuff and making a difference is very important in my work,\u201d says Andreas, who also wanted to \u201cchange the perception people have about India as a phenomenon in the 21st Century\u201d.Life in IndiaAndreas\u2019 experience of travelling in India was in stark contrast of what he had heard from friends and seen in the media. \u201cI was told about the country\u2019s poverty, rape cases, warned that I would fall sick, etc. But during my 2016 trip, I had a great time and met some warm and genuine people. They gave me the confidence to come back and work on a project. I feel at home in Mumbai, Bir and Pune. I love the coffee!\u201d There\u2019s something he misses, however: cycling through the city, like he does back in Amsterdam. \u201cIn India, it\u2019s just cabs and auto rickshaws, which isn\u2019t healthy.\u201dFeaturing 40 influential Indians such as Sunita Narain, Narayana Murthy, Kiran Majumdar, Siddhartha Benninger and Shashi Tharoor, it investigates India\u2019s development in the areas of urban development and governance, healthcare, education and agriculture. Andreas, who worked as a journalist in Amsterdam, started the process by researching on India\u2019s innovators and shooting mails to the people he wanted to speak with. He says his focus was on \u201cgetting a hold of the Indian pulse\u201d. While a lot came from the book, he followed trends on social media, spoke to people and identified politicians with solution-based views. \u201c80% of the outcome came from my research and 20% is based on recommendations by friends in India,\u201d adds the 30-year-old.But the road to creating the series wasn\u2019t easy. Before he could start recording, his shooting device \u2014 an iPhone 7 plus \u2014 was stolen in New Delhi, where he was also facing issues finding a house. Andreas then left to Pune, bought an iPhone SE and shot the entire film on that. \u201cPeople were expecting me with cameras and a big crew, but here I showed up with just a phone. They thought it was funny,\u201d he laughs, adding how many personalities like Sunita Narain (of the New-Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment) were keen to learn more about the device. The idea then, he says, became all about creating as much value with the least resources \u2014 \u201cjust like India\u2019s innovators\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne would think getting people on board and travelling across the country would be taxing. For Andreas, however, it was the funding process which was the longest and most stressful part of his journey. \u201cThe Dutch Embassy agreed to support the post-production. But the process took a year and I had also started a crowd funding campaign. At that time, I went to Bir, Himachal Pradesh, and decided to cut the wait short and edit it myself. It was only then I made the decision that it wasn\u2019t going to be a film but a documentary.\u201d When the funding did come through late last year, a major chunk went to his high school friend, Zeger de Vos, who composed the film\u2019s music and worked on the sound design.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hosting screenings in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Manipal and now Chennai (as part of the Thinnai Talkies series), Andreas plans to take the film to New Delhi, Pune, Ahmedabad and Udaipur. Post the documentary\u2019s release in October, Andreas looks forward to travelling to the Northe ast and the Andaman islands and then take the film to the US for screenings. While he\u2019s tight-lipped about the next documentary he\u2019s researching on, all he reveals is it is based in Europe. \u201cMy job as a documentary filmmaker is to change and question stereotypes, and give people a more realistic view of what\u2019s going on. One Point Seven has made me aware of the fact that there\u2019s a lot more to explore and I am now sure that I won\u2019t settle in Amsterdam. I will go back for lectures and speaking engagements to teach people about India.\u201d"

      "\nIf think you are seeing Tom Cruise, you are wrong. It's Bill Hader. \u00a0 The current viral sensation on the internet is a rather creepy video of Saturday Night Live\u2019s Bill Hader, whose face morphs into that of actors Tom Cruise and Seth Rogen even as he speaks.The video was published barely two weeks ago, but has garnered nearly 4.2 million views during that time, not to mention clips of the morphed video floating around on Twitter, Reddit and other social media sites. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Various morphed videos of actors exist, but why did this one go viral in particular?In the video, Hader recounts an incident in which he meets Cruise and Rogen, and every time he does an impression either of the two, Hader\u2019s face subtly shifts into theirs. The shift is smooth but the impact is so jarring that you can\u2019t help but wonder what sorcery this is.Fortunately, the internet has an answer. Unfortunately, it might not be an answer you\u2019d like.The Bill Hader video is an example of \u2018DeepFake\u2019, form of editing videos that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning.According to the Associated Press, deepfakes are made by feeding a computer an algorithm, or set of instructions, and lots of images and audio of a certain person. \u201cThe computer program learns how to mimic the person\u2019s facial expressions, mannerisms, voice and inflections. If you have enough video and audio of someone, you can combine a fake video of the person with a fake audio and get them to say anything you want,\u201d the news agency writes.This is not the first time deepfakes such as this one have gone viral. Earlier this year, another couple of Bill Hader videos became popular as well, this time with the actor doing impressions of Al Pacino and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Pacino video has 4.2 million views, and the Schwarzenegger video has 8.3 million views. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0These videos were all released by the same YouTube channel, Ctrl Shift Face.The channel\u2019s owner, and the creator of these videos, told The Guardian that \u201cunsettling face-swapping videos are an attempt to raise awareness in the age of fake news and footage.\u201dThe YouTube channel also has deepfake videos of Elon Musk in footage from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bruce Lee in place of Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, and more.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRepresentational image. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n  Banking and finance, government and critical infrastructure were among the most targeted sectors in India by cybercriminals in 2018-19, according to tech major Cisco. Also, about 26% of these overall attacks cost organisations in the country upwards of $5 million each. \u201cThe hackers are persistent, and their campaigns are very targeted. We have found that sectors like banking and finance (20.1%), government (19.6%) and critical infrastructure (15.1%) were among those that continue to face the highest threat of cyberattacks,\u201d Cisco India and SAARC Director (Security Business) Vishak Raman told PTI. He added that cybercriminals are also increasingly targeting sectors like defence (15.1%), IT, telecom and healthcare. \u201cThey are using a host of mechanisms like point of sale attacks to target sectors like retail, hospitality, entertainment and e-commerce. Ransomware are used to attack public sector entities, transportation as well as banking and finance verticals,\u201d he said. Raman cited an Asia-Pacific Security Capabilities Benchmark Study conducted by Cisco that found 21% respondents saying cost of breach for them was between $5-9.9 million, while another 5% said it was more than $10 million for them. The cost of breach included loss of revenue, customers, and other costs related to the event. About 27% said the cost of less than $100,000 \u2014 an indication that while the amount involved may be small but the volume of such attacks is growing. \u201cCompanies are now spending on not just protection but also increasingly on proactive threat hunting, more forensics,\u201d he said.

      "\nSantosh Thottingal\n\u00a0 Until the middle of the past decade, typing Malayalam on the computer was not as easy as it is today. That was around the time when a group of technology and language enthusiasts got together under the banner of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (SMC) with the aim of \u201cmy language for my computer\u201d.Within a few years, their efforts paid off, with the development of tools and fonts in the Unicode system, enabling a standardised Malayalam script in computers, which is now commonly used in everything from government orders to online newspapers to Internet memes.Santhosh Thottingal, a software engineer who played a key role in this transformation, has now been chosen for the Maharshi Badrayan Vyas Samman by the President in recognition of his contributions to Malayalam language. A principal software engineer with the language engineering team of Wikimedia Foundation, Mr. Thottingal is behind some of the most commonly used fonts like Manjari and Chilanka.\u201cI was active with the free software movement during my college days. The assumption then was that local languages are unsuitable for computers. That is when I came across the work done by a team of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) scientists to develop text-to-speech system for palm-held devices in Kannada. I tried to make something similar in Malayalam when I realised that we have to address the fundamental issues first \u2014 being able to type in a proper form in Malayalam. Our attempt through SMC was to build a foundation for Malayalam computing,\u201d he says.The technology for Malayalam fonts was much more complicated than for English. In Malayalam, the combined letters (Koottaksharam) and their shifting patterns had to be coded. He set aside his spare time for five years to perfect these.\u201cWe had to learn the core of Malayalam, how the language has been portrayed and the history of printing in Kerala. That is when we realised that the \u2018old Malayalam lipi\u2019 was much more scientific and beautiful. The \u2018new lipi\u2019 was developed around the 1980s, cutting down the number of letters and separating the combined letters, under the assumption that the old one could not be replicated on computers,\u201d he says.Following the work of SMC and the release of fonts in the \u2018old lipi\u2019, the Kerala government, in 2010, issued an order that all official communication online should shift to the old system. \u201cAll of our work is voluntary and does not generate any revenue, although this work did secure me a job with Wikimedia,\u201d says Santosh. Now he is about to finish an even more important project, to \u201cteach Malayalam grammar to the computer\u201d.\u201cNow, the computer understands Malayalam only as a sequence of bytes. It does not understand the language like it does English, which enables the working of devices like Alexa and Siri. For that, grammar has to be algorithmically represented and machine-translated. The work is almost over,\u201d he says.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system (AI) which can look at photographs and tell what disease the plant has and also give recommendations and treatment options to the farmers. The results showed that the model was over 90% accuracy.The neural network was given about 20,000 images showing diseased and healthy plants. \u201cJust like teaching a kid to tell an elephant from a horse, we taught the AI to identify leaf, root, fruit diseases and pests. Pictures from Uganda, Colombia, Congo and India were fed into the system for the training,\u201d says Dr. Sivalingam Elayabalan from the Department of Biotechnology, Imayam Institute of Agriculture and Technology (IIAT), Trichy, Tamil Nadu. He is one of the authors of the study published in Plant Methods.The tool is now incorporated into an App called Tumaini, meaning hope in Swahili, and being tested. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The team is planning to add more diseases based on regions and also make the App available in local languages. \u201cWhen users take the photo, it gets uploaded to a global system for large-scale monitoring. Also, it is automatically GPS-tagged so we know what and where the problem is. We are also planning to incorporate high-resolution satellite monitoring to check the health of large fields,\u201d explains Dr. Michael Gomez Selvaraj, from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia in an email to The Hindu. Dr. Selvaraj is the senior author of the paper. The App can detect symptoms on any part of the crop, and is even trained to read images of lower quality.The app is now being tested across many countries and when the confidence of 100% is reached it will be available for free download. \u201cYellow leaf spot and Fusarium wilt are the major fungal diseases in India and farmers spend a lot of money on fungicides. Apart from the fungal disease, the viral disease such as Banana Bunchy top virus is a big problem in hilly areas of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Northeast region. The App can tell the farmers in advance bringing down the treatment costs,\u201d says Dr. Elayabalan. \u201cWe are now testing the App in Tamil, and it will soon be available in Hindi and Malayalam.

      "\nA screenshot of the Number Neighbour Challenge which actor Chris Evans denied\n\u00a0 Here is the web\u2019s latest craze: the Number Neighbour Challenge. Raise your hand if you\u2019ve tried this frankly risky texting task in which you text the person one digit away from your mobile number and strike up a conversation. Could it be your next best friend? Or a serial killer? I guess you won\u2019t know until you try.But in true Internet fashion, there are some fakers out there, telling everyone their number neighbour is Chris Evans or Barack Obama. Please guys, Chris Evans is obviously busy running after Anthony Mackie with Captain America tips, and Obama is saving America from an orange with a toupee. Plus, I bet celebrities have numbers with Wingding-like characters so we can\u2019t even reach them.Anyway, what\u2019s the big deal with Number Neighbour Challenge? Simple: it\u2019s a fun version of roulette, which doesn\u2019t require you to leave the comfortable confines of your bed. (And, no, I didn\u2019t try it, my bed begged me to binge-watch the four different series.) Those who did try it, shared the screen-shots of the exchanges on their social media platforms. Some number neighbour experiences were filled with mutual excitement, while others were brimming with distrust and even straight-out hatred. Some were over-the-moon to find their new \u2018friends\u2019 had iMessage. The hashtags #NumberNeighbour and #NumberNeighbor have been trending for about a week-and-a-half, which is pretty solid for an online challenge.

      "\u201cWhen I was recruiting candidates in 2015 for the Indian operations of our education consultancy, I realised that a lot of the interviewees were not employable. They lacked communication skills and hadn\u2019t updated their knowledge to meet market needs,\u201d says Sadiq Sait. \u201cA lot of them didn\u2019t even have a proper resume; they\u2019d simply copy-paste from a friend and fail to update their basic details.\u201d The gaping hole in the Indian job market spurred him to give up his 10-year career as an education consultant for institutions abroad, and set up uLektz. \u201cI felt this was an area that needed focus,\u201d he says.uLektz is essentially a suite of apps focussed on the student community; an eco-system for higher education that addresses everything from campus updates, news, to job openings, internships and also offers them e-books and study material. The three-year-old startup ties up with educational institutions to provide them an integrated app for campus management. \u201cColleges can use the app to send notifications and updates to students. In the process, they get their own branded version. Students can benefit by connecting with peers across educational institutions; it\u2019s a sort of LinkedIn for students. It facilitates peer education across institutions and students can also use it to create and download their resumes,\u201d says Sadiq, the founder and CEO of the company. \n\n\n\n\n\nToday, they have on board over 200 colleges from across the country. Some of the colleges from the State include Amet, Bharathiraja and Alagappa. \u201cWe have also created a 360-degree marketplace. Here we have partnered with publishers, who put out e-books at discounted prices. Apart from that, we also provide a slew of free e-books that we have created to the students; these have been created as per different university syllabus. The e-books are encrypted so piracy is not possible,\u201d he says, adding that they\u2019ve also partnered with skill course providers such as Udemy and offer over 4,000 free courses on the latest technology with certifications. \u201cIn all, there are over 40,000 courses on the app that students can take to update their skills. Four thousand of these are free. We\u2019ve also incorporated vernacular languages so we have a wider reach.\u201d\u201cThe idea is to tackle under-employment; that is the new challenge these days,\u201d says Sadiq. \u201cI strongly believe when students and faculty connect across institutions, the quality of education improves and opportunities are generated. It is also a Government of India mandate to encourage digital education. So the app helps colleges get better scores in ICT when seeking accreditation.\u201dWhile most colleges have embraced this technology, one of the challenges the uLektz team faced initially was their reluctance to allow students to carry mobile phones on campus. \u201cHowever, the app is not limited to a phone. It can be used on the laptop or tablet too. The point to note here though, is that it is also important to teach students to use technology responsibly. After all, it is the future and they do need to be trained to use it,\u201d says Sadiq.His former boss Ratna Kumar, backed his decision to start uLektz and helped fund his startup. While they have remained bootstrapped so far, they are now looking to raise their first round of funding. \u201cNow that we have reasonable traction, we\u2019re looking to make inroads in Tier II and III cities. In the next year, we\u2019re also looking to expand to the Asia Pacific region where the market is huge.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Stuntin Like My Daddy\u2019 episode features Rue (Zendaya)\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nHBO\n HBO\u2019s Euphoria tackles addiction, self-exploration and other trials which come with growing up. Equally addictive is the show\u2019s cinematography. The first season just concluded but the visuals linger in your mind; picture jewel toned lights in low-lit rooms and a dizzying haze. Euphoria follows determined drug-user Rue (Zendaya) who returns from rehab with no intention of staying clean. She strikes up a friendship with fellow high-schooler Jules (Hunter Schafer) and we observe their shifting relationships with reality. Speaking with one of the show\u2019s cinematographers Marcell R\u00e9v he reveals he worked on four episodes out of the eight: the pilot, part of \u2018Stuntin\u2019 Like My Daddy,\u2019 \u2018Made You Look\u2019 and \u2018Shook One: Pt II\u2019 before moving on to other projects. \n\n\n\n\n\nCinematographer Marcell R\u00e9v \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSandor Fegyverneky\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Hungarian, who\u2019s currently in Europe shooting L\u00e9a Seydoux-starrer The Story Of My Wife, explains it was no easy journey to achieve the look and feel of the final result but the entirely collaborative process was truly a satisfying one. Excerpts:Can you talk about how you came to work on \u2018Euphoria\u2019?I had worked with Sam Levinson, the showrunner, writer and director for most of the episodes, on a film from the previous year Suki Waterhouse-starrer Assassination Nation (which premiered at Sundance Film Festival). When we finished that, he was already talking about Euphoria and we were trying to figure out how it would look and the world of Euphoria. He actually hadn\u2019t finished with the script yet, but he had an idea of what he was going for.Did you look to the original Israeli series by Ron Lesham for reference?I\u2019ll be completely honest, I haven\u2019t seen it! It was on purpose, I didn\u2019t want it to influence me and I think Sam wanted to change a lot of things; it\u2019s more like a personal work for him than an adaptation. HBO bought the license but I think the original had a completely different storyline and set of characters.What was your and Sam\u2019s collaborative process like during \u2018Euphoria\u2019?We started prep pretty early on and it\u2019s during those moments where you share ideas and images, books and other movies. These are long conversations. We narrowed it down to a reel of where your project is heading, seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t. Every time I work with Sam, I discover a lot about myself and about film-making too.Of course, we started to scout. Production designer (of four episodes) Michael Grasley was also involved pretty early. After the pilot we built most of the interiors on stage, so the three of us started to figure out the main sets of the show. \n\n\n\n\n\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Made You Look\u2019 episode with Nate (Jacob Elordi)\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nHBO\n \n\n\n\n\nHow did you balance the psychedelia and the realities of the world of these high schoolers? How did you finalise on the framing?We wanted to have something that was grounded in reality but, at the same time, as Sam phrased, wanted to give teenagers a show of what they imagine for themselves, how they would see themselves in a show. There is a lot of technical stuff you have to figure out in terms of cameras and lenses, lighting style, colours as well as the amount of haze or smoke, we had to plot how the camera would move, etc. So basically the visual language of the piece that consists of lot of small technical decisions. We wanted it to feel real but not in a way you would normally call realist, more like an emotional realism. That allows you to be a little more courageous in terms of style. You\u2019re telling the stories of these different characters (macho jock Nate, drug addict Rue, lost soul Cassie, sexually experimental Kat and more) whose lives all collide in this singular and messy world. Did their narratives drive any cinematography?We wanted to create a coherent world first as a main approach. In that same world, we dramatised each and every scene\u2026 not really by character because the production design was going by character, which came naturally. The rest is dramatising the scenes and helping with photographic ideas to make it more efficient. \n\n\n\n\n\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Shook Ones Part II\u2019 episode with Rue (Zendaya) and Jules (Hunter Schafer) at the carnival\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nHBO\n \n\n\n\n\nThe light (and sometimes absence of it) is a major element in these visuals, too! It keeps shifting, especially during these hazier parts. Was lighting controlled in real time?  Interestingly, in post-production, we didn\u2019t do a lot in that aspect. To get more technical, we had a lookup table (LUT), provided by the show\u2019s colorist Tom Poole, which we see on the set and it is used to determine the colours and contrast with which a particular scene or frame will be displayed in its final form. What we saw on set was pretty close to what ended up on the scene. So, yes, it was controlled on the set. That said, how experimental did you get with the cinematography? Was there something new you tried which you haven\u2019t done before?I\u2019m just trying to help directors create something they want and not push my own wild imagination [laughs] but I enjoy experimenting. Sam is someone who was really encouraging and pushing everyone to go as far as they can with their imagination, and I was also pushing him. It was a good force of experimentation.But this show only works when it\u2019s grounded in reality; we said to ourselves, \u2018we can allow ourselves everything within the emotional realm of the characters.\u2019 So if it\u2019s driven by an emotion, you can be really brave and we tried to be.I loved the music of \u2018Euphoria\u2019, all thanks to British musician Labrinth. In the show, the visuals, the sound and the music come together in this world. Did you stylise your work in that sense to suit the music?I love the music too! Sam and I were also kicking around ideas and listening to music. Some of them end up in the show, some don\u2019t. Plus Labrinth was working simultaneously while we were shooting, so sometimes while we would ride to set, we would be listening to all that in the car and it was inspiring. I wouldn\u2019t say we were designing or choreographing shots for the music except for the last episode which was done by Adam Newpart-Berra.\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from HBO\u2019s Euphoria\u2019s \u2018Made You Look\u2019 episode. The still sees a split screen scene of Jules (Hunter Schafer) and Nate (Jacob Elordi)\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nHBO  \n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Adam and the other DoPs, how did you guys engage continuity between the episodes?  Most of it was led by Sam so most of the communication was between him and the DoPs. But mostly we set up in the first four episodes we\u2019d set up a world. Drew Daniels, Adam Newpart-Berra and Andr\u00e9 Chemetoff took it to another level and they did such a great job.Do you have any favourite scenes or episodes?Visually, I\u2019m really proud of episode four; the carnival episode \u2018Made You Look\u2019... it was a technically challenging and also rewarding episode. The split-screen sequence in episode three and also in that same episode the scene where Rue takes pictures of Jules in her room; it\u2019s a simple but deeply emotional and honest scene and Z and Hunter are just so good in it.Naturally there are emotionally difficult subject matters here. What did you observe in terms of the actors\u2019 approaches to these issues? Were you nervous prior to the show airing?The fact that the cast was this young made the topics more sensitive. But the actors were so mature and professional; I was so impressed. For any sexual subjects, HBO has an intimacy coordinator who\u2019s constantly present and helps communicate with the director and the actors. And when you talk about these issues in a profound and direct way, that\u2019s the best way to approach these subjects in a safe zone. "

      "\u201cWe want to be known as more than just a team that plays professional football,\u201d says Sudhir Menon, chief business officer of Chennai City Football Club (CCFC). To widen its scope, the company has planned to introduce amateur football and beach football events. More intriguingly, it plans to take India up to professional levels in esports.Enter: CCFC\u2019s FIFA on console tournament, scheduled for this weekend, which gives PS4 gamers a chance to win cash prizes of up to \u20b95,000 as well as a host of merchandise, by beating everyone else at the EA version of FIFA 2019.Though Menon admits that esports are picking up in India, \u201cmost of it is just an excuse to meet more like-minded people.\u201d The idea behind this tournament, scheduled for this weekend, is to up the notch in terms of talent and professionalism, and it came about when CCFC looked Westward for some inspiration. \u201cThe Switzerland-based soccer team, FC Basel, have their own esports team which is very professional,\u201d explains Menon. \u201cThey also have 26% ownership of CCFC, which means that eventually, we will be able to send our winners from India to scouting tournaments there, if they seem good enough to be a part of such teams.\u201dBut that\u2019s the future plan. For now, CCFC is focussing on making this maiden tournament a success. \u201cAs of three days ago, we had about 75 registrations. But more people are registering each day, and spot registrations are also open,\u201d says Menon.Winners of the tournament get a cash prize of \u20b95,000. Runners up get \u20b92,500, and those in the third place get \u20b91,000. The entry fee is \u20b9300, and re-entries cost \u20b9100. Exclusive merchandise by FC Basel and Uhlsport will also be awarded.The tournament will be held at Blur, Sathyam Cinemas, on August 17 and 18 from 11 am onwards.

      "\nGautami Enclave Community Park is maintained with the green initiatives underway in the colony\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani   It\u2019s tough to imagine the area which is now a major congestion zone \u2014 choking with vehicle overload \u2014 was open land with a forest of sky-scraping eucalyptus trees eight years ago. Go a little deeper into Kondapur and you\u2019ll find yourself happening across Gautami Enclave, a Stepford-like colony of friendly greetings everyday, waving watchmen and laughing children on bicycles... the collective image is not unlike the billboards for upcoming residential complexes. This real happiness is the result of years of green initiatives which bring together apartment complexes from different construction names \u2014 named Project Neer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the components in the rain-water harvesting schemes across the colony\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n \n\n\n\n\nThough Project Neer officially kicked off in 2015, the practices were in place a few years before then. Gautami Enclave Residents\u2019 Welfare Association president Sridhar Yalamanchili was one of the first people to start working towards what the colony is now, and it was no small feat to get to this point. He laughs and shakes his head as he remembers the early days, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to convince people of these methods, but we started by placing the rainwater harvesting models in two apartment buildings to see how feasible it would be, and to also show how scalable it is.\u201dHis treasurer Lakshminarayan Rao adds that probably no one would\u2019ve adapted it were it not for the living proof of the model. Other buildings in the colony, old and new, took on the then-simpler rainwater harvesting models which featured the basic gutter, catchment, down-take pipes, delivery pipelines and filter leading to the borewells. As the years passed, more buildings which were added to the community upgraded their water conservation methods; by 2011, it was practically synonymous to live green if you thought of moving to Gautami Enclave. Grey water is also seen to at Gautami Enclave. At Lakshminarayan\u2019s building and a few others, old school charcoal pits with stones are used to filter out the soap and foam from the grey water. The charcoal filters out contaminants while the stones keep out the larger particles. As a result of this feature and the rainwater harvesting scheme, these buildings have reduced tanker dependency by up to 80%. \n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers digging and building a rain-water harvesting pit in the colony\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n \n\n\n\n\nNow around 70 buildings in the colony have a rainwater harvesting system in place, with each building having its own borewell. The colony has over around 90 rainwater harvesting pits, including those in building premises. Speed-breakers, being a road safety feature, also channel the rainwater to the pits from the buildings\u2019 pipes. To add to the growing repertoire, there are four 100-plus foot injection well pits. The ordering of water tankers has even reduced by up to 50%. To offer some perspective, on a heavy rainy day, the total rainwater harvested in the colony can be up to 11,000 litres, says Sridhar.Accountability is a key component to the colony functioning seamlessly as well. Lakshminarayan adds, \u201cWe encouraged each apartment building, whatever its size to get water meters installed. Once people start paying through their nose, they start to be more aware. Every drop is accounted for and water isn\u2019t used mindlessly. Everyone \u2014 the residents, gardeners, housekeepers \u2014 are ingratiated with this information.\u201dIt\u2019s not just conserving but sharing too, even with the four-legged friends. Lakshminarayan points to a white and tawny indie dog happily lapping away at a bowl of clean water.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn indie dog enjoys water from bowls provided by Animal Water Bowl \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe worked with Animal Water Bowl Project to bring these about for the dogs. We don\u2019t shoo away these indie dogs, they\u2019re friendly. Plus we don\u2019t let the water stagnate. We replace the water if there\u2019s any left and we use bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) in between washes of the bowl, and on the streets, to prevent any risk of dengue and malaria.\u201d There are also poop-free zones in the colony for pet-owners to maintain the upkeep of their neighbourhoods. Planting trees is a major oxygen-pumping routine here. Last June and July, the colony slowly met a goal of planting 5,000 saplings throughout the area, including 1,000-plus in the Botanical Garden park, and along the Laxmi Nagar road in between \u2014 some of these saplings, unfortunately have been removed with the flyover construction. Lakshminarayan states, \u201cThough there are \u2018Chirec Public School\u2019 boards near these saplings, they were planted by us. But we don\u2019t mind, as long as they\u2019re maintaining!\u201dTo manage all this obviously requires a wise amount of spending. As a colony would operate ideally, Lakshminarayan says there\u2019s always transparency around GERWA\u2019s funds. \n\n\n\n\n\nGERWA treasurer Lakshminarayan Rao and GERWA president Sridhar Yalamanchili\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nFinancial sustainability is vital, he says, adding, \u201cEverything is maintained by us, even our sports ground. Each building has two representatives: one president and one secretary. They are the management committee (MC) members who in turn elect nine election members who make up GERWA committee. We communicate with the MC members where the money is going and they have to educate their residents about the initiatives. To a large extent, this does happen, but some are still... not entirely active.\u201d Other initiatives at Gautami Enclave include having e-waste bins and waste segregation with Waste Ventures, the profits of which go to the watchmen who oversee the correct segregation. Now that\u2019s scalable. Planet Healers celebrates green initiatives. If you know an eco-warrior, email us at hydmetroplus@thehindu.co.in"

      "After Amazon and Samsung, Google became the latest consumer technology company to strengthen its sustainability measures this year. Last week, the tech giant announced that it would include recycled materials in all of its Made By Google products by 2022. By 2020, it said, 100% of all shipments going to or coming from customers will be carbon-neutral. \u201cWe\u2019re always working to do more, faster. But today, we\u2019re laying the foundation for what we believe will be a way of doing business that commits to building better products, better,\u201d Anna Meegan, head of sustainability, consumer hardware at Google, wrote in the company\u2019s official blog last Tuesday.The company also claims that its carbon emissions for product shipments have decreased by 40%. Google\u2019s announcement follows Amazon\u2019s to invest in two new renewable energy projects in the US and Ireland, and Samsung\u2019s to work with the United Nations (UN) to boost awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals.\u201cMajor investments in renewable energy are a critical step to address our carbon footprint globally,\u201d Amazon\u2019s director of sustainability, Kara Hurst, said in a statement, earlier this month.Samsung, during its Galaxy Note 10 launch, unveiled the Samsung Global Goals app, to raise awareness for the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals program. According to its website, the app will be available in 19 languages and will come pre-installed on the Note 10.It mightn\u2019t be a coincidence that these technology behemoths are reinforcing their sustainability commitments. According to World Meteorological Organization data, last July was around 1.2\u00b0C warmer than the average temperatures in July during the pre-industrial era. This March, in the UN high-level meeting on climate and sustainable development, its General Assembly President Mar\u00eda Fernanda Espinosa Garc\u00e9s warned: \u201cWe are the last generation that can prevent irreparable damage to our planet.\u201dIt is literally now or never.Google already has several sustainability measures in place. In June, for instance, it came up with the idea of a \u2018circular economy\u2019 that focuses on recycling, reusing, refurbishing and prolonging.\u201cOur goal is to embed circular economic principles into the fabric of Google\u2019s infrastructure, operations, and culture,\u201d says Kate Brandt, Google\u2019s Lead for Sustainability. \u201cWhat that means is that we\u2019ll be focusing on opportunities wherever possible to eradicate waste through circular design \u2014 at our data centers, in our kitchens, on our campuses, in all we do around the world.\u201dThese efforts might seem impressive of Google, but the tech behemoth\u2019s just trying to offset its considerable carbon emission. It claims that its data centres \u201cuse 50% less energy than a typical data centre\u201d. But the sheer size of the company makes it one of the largest CO2 emitters. According to a 2018 Quartz report, the world\u2019s most popular website accounts for about 40% of the Internet\u2019s carbon footprint. And a study from 2015 suggests internet activity results in as much CO2 emissions as the global aviation industry.Google\u2019s social conscience, hence, needn\u2019t be treated as altruism and it\u2019s about time other companies resort to more sustainable practices.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHow simple and effective is the ClearTax E-Filing app? \n",
      "Updated: August 14, 2019 15:09 IST\rPublished: August 12, 2019 19:49 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/how-simple-and-effective-is-the-cleartax-e-filing-app/article29030045.ece",
      "Paperwork is the bane of people\u2019s existence in the 21stCentury... so we\u2019ve moved to trust the open territories of cyberspace to automate the boring parts of our lives. And when that mid-year time to makes sense of our taxes comes around, it can be another stress to merely try to decipher all the steps. Don\u2019t we all wish we had a mandatory tax course in college or high school? Well, fintech company ClearTax recently announced the launch of its new app \u2014 ClearTax E-Filing \u2014 to help taxpayers file income tax returns, free of cost.It\u2019s no revelation how a number of us trust the power of the mobile to make quick transactions through mobile banking and Unified Payments Interfaces (UPIs), especially on-the-move taxpayers across the younger workforce. This trend has been seen not only in Tier 1 but is also consistent across traffic coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.Archit Gupta, founder and CEO of ClearTax, explains, \u201cThe new app, with its easy interface, makes income tax filing extremely simple for those who are on the go. With a single tap, a user can upload Form 16 and their Income Tax Return can be filed in under seven minutes.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe constantly strive to make tax filing easier for taxpayers. App has been received well, in last 12 days, we have seen 20,000+ app installs and we are already witnessing a 4x jump in conversion rates as compared to mobile web. For easy understanding of terms, we have included hyperlinks at relevant places where our customers can simply tap and get detailed information to help understand and complete e-filing of ITR on their own, without depending on anyone else. Several taxpayers have applauded the ease and convenience we are offering.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what happens in this claimed seven-minute window? ClearTax app allows taxpayers to simply upload their Form 16 and then it auto-populates their ITR form. If the taxpayer has been employed with more than one employer during the financial year, he or she can upload more than one Form 16 on the app to file their ITR. Taxpayers can also add income details manually on the app and ClearTax will automatically compute any tax liability. Taxpayers who need help may opt for expert assistance to file their ITR. ClearTax app also provides an option to pre-fill data from the income tax-filing portal.Despite ClearTax E-Filing claiming to cover many bases here, this development hasn\u2019t exactly been met with positivity. Twitter and Facebook have been amok with complaints of the app itself malfunctioning. Vendor Vinay Sharma residing in Hyderabad shares, \u201cI\u2019ve received notifications that my filing isn\u2019t complete and I cannot make head or tail of this app either. Maybe I\u2019m not that tech-literate, but if they say they want to help our community, they could make it clearer.\u201dChartered accountant Ramesh Gopinathan* has been in the industry for 15 years. He\u2019s seen a few of his clients and friends try to use ClearTax E-Filing. \u201cThe app is aimed at those who want ease of access and comprehension, but some who have used the app often come to me and ask me to decipher the initial stages. This is a huge responsibility ClearTax\u2019s app should be ready for. It\u2019s a reputed organisation in tax circles, they should make it easy.\u201dManjunath, a tax auditor based in Bengaluru, says, \u201cIn my 12 years of experience, I have seen many people gravitating towards e-filing options like ClearTax. I guess the main reason is because it\u2019s free of cost. But I\u2019d suggest that they go for the Income Tax Department\u2019s e-filing website [http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in]. Also, there are still a lot of people who do it the manual way.\u201d*Name changed to protect identity(With inputs from Praveen Sudevan)You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nTikTok turns one: When one year lapses into 30 seconds...\n\n",
      "Updated: August 18, 2019 15:04 IST\rPublished: August 12, 2019 17:37 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/tiktok-turns-one-year-old-when-one-year-lapses-into-30-seconds/article29020634.ece",
      "Five years ago, if we told our friends that we could be famous for making short and stylised videos and become internationally famous, our friends would probably question our mindsets and priorities. Well, TikTok having just turned a year old is the culmination of various short-video movements (remember Vine?) and its creators are saying the platform won\u2019t suffer the same curses its counterparts have.But such a platform doesn\u2019t come without its glitches \u2014 and we aren\u2019t talking about the ones of a software nature. The Internet is great at fuelling offline battles as well. TikTok was no different; the platform was the centre of a November 2018 fight between two groups in Malappuram, Kerala, resulting in eight people being injured over the then-viral Nillu Nillu Challenge.The following months until April saw netizens misusing the platform, often losing their lives. Even worries around child pornography were raised and the Madras High Court stepped in to order a ban on the app across the country. On April 17, the Supreme Court\u2019s order on the ban took effect and the app was removed from Apple and Android app stores. But barely a week later, the ban is revoked on the conditions of strict community guidelines. Talk about a bounce-back. \n\n\n\nWatch | TikTok turns one\n\n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/rULV14sY-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\nLike Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, those under 13 years of age aren\u2019t permitted to use the app (we don\u2019t see much of this rule being actively followed across these sites) and the platform has a strict censor as \u201cnot being a place for graphic, violent, shocking, or sensational content.\u201dChallenges galoreHere are some of the prominent trends on TikTok#CleanIndia: Launched in partnership with Bhumi, a campaign that promotes the government mission of Swachh Bharat and encourages users to post before and after pictures of their contribution to a cleaner India.#SkillsIndia: Launched in partnership with NSDC, a campaign that invites youth to share their skills and talent on TikTok.#EduTok: One of the most popular campaigns, that encourages users to create content around various themes, with a focus on education, motivation, health and wellness.How are these strict guidelines implemented, you ask? Sachin Sharma, director of sales and partnerships at TikTok India, says, \u201cTikTok has put in place protective measures by combining content moderation technology with a robust human moderation team. This team, which is based in over 20 countries and regions, now covers 36 languages, an increase of 400% in terms of language support from one year ago. In India, the moderation team covers 15 major Indian languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Gujarati and more.\u201d\u201cWe have a robust localisation strategy to encourage users to create content relevant to their local cultures. Some of our top creators are the ones sharing content and skills that help add value to a user\u2019s life,\u201d Sachin points out, \u201cBe it Sangeeta Jain, known as Geet on TikTok, who teaches English and gives relationship advice, or Tamil TechGuruji who shares tech advice in Tamil in short videos on TikTok. There are many more such examples of creators who are leveraging the platform for the larger good of the society.\u201dSo what do the creators say? Motivational speaker Awal TsMadaan teaches English through TikTok and has approximately five million followers on the platform. He is also well-known on YouTube with over 7.6 million subscribers. \u201cThere is an interesting concept of sales,\u201d he points out, \u201cand it is considered to be a good thing for extroverts. But social media\u2019s digital economy empowers all the introverts to come forward too as well. That is when brands offer partnerships and a new form of storytelling emerges.\u201d He adds TikTok has appealed to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities on a scale which other short-video platforms couldn\u2019t do before; there\u2019s no requirement for a high-end smartphone with a fantastic camera or a full-on set-up with lights and multiple camera angles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAwal is one of many who consider TikTok to be \u2018revolutionary\u2019, but like any digital space, the action of trolling is ubiquitous. Sachin lays out, \u201cIn India, TikTok partnered with the Cyber Peace Foundation, an award-winning NGO and global think-tank of cyber-security and policy experts, to promote online safety. As a part of this campaign, they launched 11 posters that illustrated and educated internet users on various aspects of online safety.\u201dBut Awal, as a creator, does see there is a responsibility across creators, followers and TikTok itself. As with any democratic space, it is a combination of self-regulation and intervention from the platform to keep things afloat\u2026 after all, as mentioned before, TikTok is still under a watchful eye. During the lockdown earlier this year, Awal recalled the controversies across all platforms. \u201cEvery platform has its own phases of evolution, and a platform is considered a great platform when it proactively takes action,\u201d he observes. \u201cMy gut feeling was that it would subside soon, because I\u2019d seen that proactiveness over time,\u201d he states.As TikTok blows out this candle, it looks like they\u2019ve done what some of their creators feel is needed to keep things moving. But the shelf-life is still young.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\nMarvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order\n\u00a0 The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which started with Jon Favreau\u2019s Iron Man in 2008, is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, raking in over $22.5 billion at the box office.The films apart, Marvel has spawned several games, too. Lego Marvel Super Heroes, Insomniac Games\u2019 Spider-Man, several fighting games by Capcom are among the popular ones. The latest release (announced at this year\u2019s E3), Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, lives up to the high standards you expect from the franchise.Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black OrderDeveloper: Team NinjaPublisher: NintendoPrice: \u20b94000 Approx ($59.99) for Nintendo SwitchIf you think you\u2019ve had enough of the Infinity Stones story which played out in the MCU over the last 10 years, then brace yourself for its retelling in the game.Apart from the fundamental premise of the heroes fighting Thanos and his supervillain squad, Black Order, the game\u2019s story is a lot different from the movies. It, however, has all Marvel superhero teams \u2014 Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, X-Men, Defenders and more \u2014 trying to stop the mad Titan from acquiring the Infinity Stones. Yes, expect plenty of \u2018oh man, everyone really is here!\u2019 excitement. The game engages you with action-filled adventures across familiar locations from the movies and comics.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writing is snappy. Though, without a shadow of doubt, the best parts of the game are when you\u2019re in the midst of a fight and whilst creating your dream superhero team.Think of Ultimate Alliance 3 as Diablo with superheroes. With the overhead perspective, you control a team of heroes against an endless supply of bad guys sent by the Black Order. It\u2019s a dream come true to have Black Panther, Deadpool, Miles Morales\u2019 Spider-Man and Wolverine in one team, bashing the bad guys together. You can also avoid mix-and-match and go with the regular teams like X-Men or the Defenders. And the game also lets you bring in heroes integral to the story and unlock more to team up with.Apart from the regular heavy and light attacks, you get four special moves, which if pulled off with other characters gives you a synergy boost. And, if you time it right with all four moves, you get an ultimate attack. While you can switch between characters in solo play, the game becomes even more fun if you have your friends controlling other characters on the Switch. The game can become repetitive. But this can be offset by playing as different characters. The game\u2019s graphics are decent, considering it\u2019s on the Switch. If you love the Marvel universe, then this is the game for you. While it does have its flaws, it\u2019s a fun game that lets you make a team with your favourite Marvel characters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nChances are you may not have heard of this developer, but you may have been a big fan of their games. They are known for their bloody and brutal Ninja Gaiden series, as well as their infamous Dead Or Alive fighting game. Team Ninja has carved a niche for themselves, being one of the undisputed masters of the action game genre.

      "\nSharing economy: A laser-guided land leveller helps farmers save groundwater and raise productivity.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nTHE HINDU\n  A laser-guided land leveller harnesses technology to accurately flatten a field in a fraction of the time used by a traditional oxen-powered scraper.The result? Farmers save precious groundwater and increase productivity by 10 to 15%.The hitch? Such hitech levellers cost at least \u20b93 lakh, way beyond the reach of the average small farmer.But a new app that\u2019s being described as \u201cUber for tractors\u201d offers a solution.\u201cWe want farmers to have affordable access to cutting-edge technology at their doorsteps,\u201d says a senior Agriculture Ministry official. \u201cThere are now more than 38,000 custom hiring centres (CHCs) across the country, which rent out 2.5 lakh pieces of farm equipment every year. By the end of the month, we plan to launch a new mobile app to efficiently connect farmers with these CHCs, just like Uber connects you to cabs.\u201dThe CHC app is already open for registrations by the farmers, societies and entrepreneurs who run these centres. So far, almost 26,800 CHCs have registered to offer more than one lakh pieces of equipment for hire. Once the app is officially launched, farmers who wish to hire equipment can register using their names, addresses and mobile numbers, and then punch in their requirements. \u201cSay, I need a rotovator with tractor for one acre of land. The app will show me the CHCs which have the equipment available within five, 20 and 50 km of my location, with their rates,\u201d explained the official. \u201cI can then call the CHC or just use the app to book the equipment at a specific time and location, and it will turn up just like an Uber.\u201d Feedback from both the CHC and the farmers contributes to a rating system, allowing customers to make informed decisions. The Ministry\u2019s app will also create an invaluable database for policy-makers, who can track the use and cost of equipment. The system would also help to track the usage of new technology that the government wants to promote, such as the Happy Seeder that aims to prevent stubble burning that causes air pollution, or solar dryers that can help farmers process and preserve their produce.\u201cWe have already done very successful demo runs in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab,\u201d said the official.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Even as Kerala was battling a flood on the ground, there has been a deluge of fake news in social media platform, aimed at spreading fear and insecurity among the people. Three major such fake news items went viral over WhatsApp and Facebook, prompting authorities to issue clarifications and warnings against the spread of misinformation.The first such fake message on Friday claimed that all of the major dams, including the Idukki dams, have reached capacity and that the shutters are about to be opened. Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) had to come out with a clarification saying that all the dams, including Idukki, Pampa, Kakki, Sholayar, Idamalayar, Kundala and Mattupetti, have filled up only to around 30% of their full capacity. It requested people living in these regions to not fall for these rumours.Within hours, BSEB had again to press its fake news busting capabilities into service after a second claim began spreading online, on how the entire State will be experiencing power outages for the next two days. This time, a post on the KSEB Facebook page warned of legal action against anyone spreading such fake news.But this clarification ended up creating some confusion later, as people did not initially believe the KSEB announcement in the evening that power supply to Kannur and Kasaragod districts have been stopped due to floods and landslips. Many images from last year\u2019s floods were used by fake news peddlers to spread misleading information online.Another fake news that began spreading around noon claimed that petrol pumps in the State will remain closed for the next three days, as tankers are stuck on the Mumbai-Bengaluru Highway due to incessant rain. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran put up a post busting this fake news.He said that spreading such news is punishable under Section 54 of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, with up to one year of imprisonment and a fine.Last year too, there was a massive spread of fake news online during the unprecedented floods that hit Kerala. An imposter wearing an Indian Army combat uniform appeared in a video spreading misinformation about the rescue and relief efforts in Kerala, prompting the Indian Army to issue a warning.The fake messages ranged from stories about bursting of dams to fake calls for rescue. The volume of fake information was so much that the Chief Minister had to issue a warning to those involved in such activities to abstain from spreading misinformation on WhatsApp and social media networks.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nFile photo of the Electron rocket about to launch from the Mahia Peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand, Thursday, May 25, 2017.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Small-satellite launch firm Rocket Lab plans to recover the core booster of its Electron rocket using a helicopter, a bold cost-saving concept that, if successful, would make it the second company after Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX to reuse an orbital-class rocket booster.\u201cElectron is going reusable,\u201d Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck said during a presentation in Utah, showing an animation of the rocket sending a payload into a shallow orbit before speeding back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The Auckland-based company is one of a growing cadre of launch companies looking to slash the cost of sending shoebox-sized satellites to low Earth orbit, building smaller rockets and reinventing traditional production lines to meet a growing payload demand.Electron, which has flown seven missions so far, can send up to 225 kg into space for roughly $7 million. Medium-class launchers such as Los Angeles-based Relativity Space can send up to 1,000 kg into space for $10 million while Texas-based firm Firefly can do it for $15 million. Unlike SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket, which reignites its engines to land steadily back on Earth, Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron will deploy a series of parachutes to slow its fall through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWe tried out virtual reality gaming in Chennai\n\n",
      "Updated: August 7, 2019 18:19 IST\rPublished: August 7, 2019 17:56 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vr-virtual-reality-gaming-experiences-in-chennai/article28859110.ece",
      "I\u2019ve always been cocky about my chances of survival in horror movies. But standing here at VR Galaxy, inside a haunted house escape game simulation that is playing out through my virtual reality headset, I\u2019m not so sure. I move forward in the game hesitantly, dodging flying bats and pale screaming banshees. (Yelp!)It\u2019s a rainy evening, perfect for staying indoors. But what adventures can be had indoors? So I head to VR Galaxy, at Ispahani Centre in Nungambakkam. The centre offers six different types of virtual reality experiences from roller-coaster rides to shooting games and immersion zones such as the VR Escape Horror. The latter is what I go for, first.To put it simply, VR (virtual reality) is a simulation done through a computer software, that puts the user in new environments. The 3D simulation takes place through the headset you wear, which also senses your motion. However, it is unadvisable for people prone to migraines and epilepsy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPriyadarshan, who manages the centre along with B Kamalashri, places a mask over my face before putting the VR headset over my head. The mask has a rectangular hole for my eyes, covering the area around them, including my forehead. \u201cFor your hygiene. It\u2019s a fifteen-minute simulation, and people tend to sweat a lot in them,\u201d says Priyadarshan. He hands me a joystick controller. \u201cIf you press this button on the controller, you can move forward in the game. To make turns, you have to turn your body,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust remember one thing, to get the full experience out of this, you need to forget that this is just a game.\u201d A case of suspension of disbelief. I am transported to an alternate dimension where I am standing outside a dilapidated house that looks like it is from the 18th Century. The doors creak open, and I step inside velvet walls with questionable stains. A gramophone record plays somewhere, and I move towards the sound. \u201cNow you see me\u2026 Now you don\u2019t\u201d \u2014 a little girl\u2019s sing-song whispers travel from one ear to another. When I move downstairs, I can sense my own jerky thuds \u2014 little touches like these make the experience realistic. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn between the game, doors open randomly inviting me to different rooms, from libraries to movie theatres \u2014 each holding a horror of its own. Finally, I reach the last corridor but standing at the gate is a demon. As soon as I take one step forward, it rushes to my face, screaming. I scream back at it, and shut my eyes tight. Just when I can\u2019t take it anymore, a scroll appears: You survived.Check these placesVR Galaxy at Ispahani Centre, Nungambakkam; Mayajaal, ECR; and Blur, Sathyam Cinemas. Call 9500008280VR World at Grand Mall, VGP Selva Nagar, Velachery. Call 7550000300Also try the VR pod at the Gaming Zone in VR Mall, Anna Nagar. Call 33705555\u201cOne of our customers got so scared, he threw away his headset. We still have to replace that one,\u201d Priyadarshan informs me, after I take mine off. Despite the horror game, most of the people who come to VR Galaxy are children and teenagers, accompanied by their parents. The horror game is the only one they do not recommend for children \u2014 the rest are quite child-friendly. Two brothers, under the age of 10, are shooting away at zombies, as we speak. \u201cWe are also working on an interactive multiplayer game, where you can see the other player in VR and communicate with them, irrespective of which centre you are playing from,\u201d says Bhuvana Ganesh. Bhuvana and her husband Ganesh KG started VR Galaxy in 2017. So much was the demand that they managed to open five centres in two years. \u201cWe work with three developers,\u201d she says, explaining that many of the games are originals.\n\n\n\n\n\nVR gaming is on the rise in India, however, for those who are not regular gamers and have not invested in headsets and controllers, such centres come in handy. \u201cOur next plan is to create an arcade with a caf\u00e9. We want to develop as many games as possible in one pod, so that resources are not wasted,\u201d she says.After the thrill of the horror house, I look for something tamer. The rollercoaster/soccer pod is popular among children. In this, you get to either experience a rollercoaster ride in a Jurassic Park-esque world populated by dinosaurs, or you can play soccer (you can manipulate the ball only through headbutts). However, I go for the Adv-walk. The concept is simple: You are on a hot air balloon that has caught fire, and to escape it, you need to walk on a plank to reach another balloon, but you are 5,000 feet up in the air. The set-up is such that you need to walk on an actual wooden plank that is two feet wide. A harness, hanging from the ceiling is placed around you, and travels with you as you move. The sensor in front captures your movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the headset is on, I see rocky mountains, deep gorges and blue skies. A bald eagle keeps me company. The plank I could have walked across in a jiffy is now suddenly making my knees tremble; I lose my balance and the harness saves me from a fall. If I closed my eyes, I could walk easily, but Priyadarshan is beside me, instructing me to look around and describe the surroundings.Having crossed the plank, I call it a day and make space for the children waiting in line. The whole reason VR works is because of the human ability to believe in something despite knowing it\u2019s not real. Delusions, sometimes, can be good.VR games start at \u20b9150, and prices vary across centres.

      "\n\nHealth-tech startup 'Together for Her' aims to streamline maternity care in India\n\n",
      "Updated: August 7, 2019 15:45 IST\rPublished: August 5, 2019 20:10 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/health-tech-startup-together-for-her-aims-to-streamline-maternity-care/article28825445.ece",
      "With hospitals mushrooming in almost every city neighbourhood across the country, many find themselves picking a maternity hospital or clinic by word-of-mouth or by going through whichever doctor they trust. But what if you\u2019re new to a city and the basic medical Yelp-like e-platforms lose their credibility? It\u2019s safe to say a \u2018verified review\u2019 badge doesn\u2019t vouch for much these days.With everything going mobile, Avegen health-tech startup decided to go deeper with data and they broke the surface with Together for Her (TfH), a maternal health solution for women in India, a sub-sect of Avegen. TfH is enabled by HealthMachine\u2122, Avegen\u2019s care management system and mother companion app. To keep the movement going, TfH has been selected to join the Berlin-based Vodafone Institute\u2019s F-LANE Accelerator. As one of the five ventures chosen from 280 applicants worldwide, and the only Asian winner, TfH will join the seven week-programme in Berlin.Dr Nayan Kalnad is a clinician and has worked in digital health for close to 11 years. He is the CEO of Avegen and has observed the scalable growth of TfH since its inception. At the current stage, TfH is an app for mothers, as well as a health-tracking software for hospitals, but most importantly, it isn\u2019t a replacement for doctors. When asking him how scalable it currently is, he responds, \u201cRight now, the software is available in Hindi, English and Marathi, but other languages can be added, when needed. The software also allows for localisation in terms of hospital preferences. If, in some areas, certain tests are not available or not needed (i.e. certain vaccinations), the software allows for personalisation with minimal effort. The key requirement is to make hospitals, as well as mothers, aware of the solution. We are now raising capital to expand our footprint in India and internationally. We are currently active in five states in India, have over 30,000 reviews and over 1,000 hospitals reviewed. We are currently expanding our pilot in bundled services from Pune to multiple cities in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, which only requires a willingness from the provider to agree to partner with us. There are no additional implementation costs from our side.\u201dAccording to 2015 datasets from UNICEF, more than 44,000 women in India die each year from pregnancy-related causes and less than 40% of women in India receive antenatal care. These statistics alone are enough for a patient to feel lost. \u201cIn order to prevent the major complications causing maternal death, one of the key requirements is that women have access to healthcare and receive comprehensive, evidence-based, proactive care,\u201d points out Dr Nayan. He adds that this basic requirement is often not met. According to National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data extrapolations, an astounding 60% of women did not go for an antenatal check in their first trimester, and more than three in 10 Indian women did not receive postnatal care within two days of delivery (International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and ICF, 2015-2016).He continues to explain that the lower-income bracket of the market is where they\u2019re aiming a good deal of their services all by creating a comprehensive end-to-end experience from laboratory work to antenatal services. Dr Nayan adds, \u201cThe care bundle also includes access to relevant knowledge and community support through a vernacular mobile app. Lastly, by offering this bundled care at a transparent price-point that transfers the price benefits of aggregated demand to the mother, and offering the option to spread the costs through monthly payments, the bundles foster affordability. In this way, we take away the four key barriers why women do not access healthcare.\u201d That said, the platform is careful that there isn\u2019t an information overload. In terms of impact, they developed a real-time, reliable, quality-of-care metric, by launching a mother feedback-based review platform, that allows new mothers receiving care in private hospitals registered with us, to provide objective actionable feedback on their delivery experience.So what can they look forward to at the F-LANE programme? Dr Nayan explains that the real-time collaboration and development that TfH will undergo will be more tangible, given the platform of the international femtech and social impact industry. He mentions the globalisation opportunities too, \u201cIt allows us to step back from our daily operations and focus on mid and long-term strategy. We are also able to learn from the other start-ups that are present from Ghana, Nigeria, UK and Germany. Seeing how other companies tackle similar problems, even though in different markets or industries, will allow for tremendous learning opportunities.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nNoida-based startup Lal10 is optimising how handloom clusters streamline global orders\n\n",
      "Updated: August 5, 2019 17:18 IST\rPublished: August 5, 2019 17:18 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/lal10-startup-optimises-how-handloom-clusters-streamline-global-orders/article28823180.ece",
      "As this goes to print, a team in Noida is coordinating with a person from the weaving community in Maheshwar, to manage an order for handwoven hemp fabric, which they received from a boutique in Los Angeles.In a nutshell, this encapsulates what Lal10, a four-and-a-half-year-old startup, has managed to do by cleverly leveraging tech. The B2B venture \u2014 run by Maneet Gohil, 29, Sanchit Govil, 30, and Albin Jose, 27 \u2014 has been trying to connect India\u2019s handloom and handicraft sectors, with global retailers of various kinds, looking for genuine and quality handmade products.\u201cWith our experience, we\u2019ve identified that this isn\u2019t a demand-constraint sector, but a supply-constraint one,\u201d says Maneet, explaining how many retailers have passed off cheap power-loom alternatives to buyers looking for genuine handloom.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, you can find a cheap knock-off of a Chanderi dupatta, of the famous Madhya Pradesh weaving cluster, in Old Delhi\u2019s Chandni Chowk for at least \u20b91,000 less.The trio started Lal10 in 2015, operating first out of their apartment room in Bengaluru. This is where Maneet and Sanchit, graduates from the Delhi College of Engineering, were working as trainees at Flipkart. Albin, another friend, who graduated from IIT Madras, would join them soon after.Lal10\u2019s current model of operations is borrowed from the ITC Limited\u2019s e-Choupal programme, through which the company would directly connect with farmers in rural India to procure agri and aquaculture produce.The team of 28 now works with 1,200 artisans across Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, Manipur, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana. In each of these states, they have a point-person, in the weaving clusters or artisan groups, with whom they work. They call this person the \u2018Cluster Champion\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Lal10 had provided each of these Cluster Champions with a \u20b96,000 WhatsApp-enabled smartphone through which they\u2019d communicate and coordinate orders. This helped for a while, with Lal10\u2019s revenue increasing five-fold. But this got tricky to sustain. The cluster wouldn\u2019t just trust a WhatsApp message confirming an order. They\u2019d need more assurance than that \u2014 they\u2019d need at least a voice.In 2018, Lal10 hired 10 interns from IIT Bombay, who set out to further identify how they could streamline this system. Their findings \u2014 no 24x7 electricity, but cheap and decent mobile data, with app-literacy extending to the likes of TikTok and PUBG \u2014 had them confident that a dashboard, full with a mobile app, is the best way to optimise and streamline their business.They quickly outsourced building a customer relationship management (CRM), but Albin oversaw customisations specific to Lal10\u2019s requirements. Soon, the CRM app was installed into the Cluster Champion\u2019s phone, and all departments within Lal10\u2019s teams started working through the dashboard.The sales team would be alerted as soon as they received an order on a website like Alibaba; they\u2019d then understand their quantity and design-specifics, as well as budget and deadline; the design team would then be alerted in case of any specificity in order, with Cluster Champion receiving a ping.Empowering gen-nextLal10\u2019s team has 16 textile and accessory designers from NIFTs across India, and NID. Depending on order and trends, they help in design interventions at weaving clusters \u2014 without hampering the traditional practices \u2014 to experiment with weaving new-age \u2018green\u2019 material like bamboo for accessories, and hemp and banana fibre for fabric.\u201cWe get 3,000 orders each month, some of them as specific as wanting 50 metres of handwoven fabric from Phulia [a weaving cluster in West Bengal],\u201d says Sanchit. \u201cThe CRM helps in scalability and efficiency.\u201dWhat this also means is that in case the weavers have extra inventory that they\u2019ve just stocked, they can log it onto the CRM, and Lal10 can bridge the gap between supply and demand even further \u2014 meaning weavers don\u2019t have to wait to go to the next exhibition in a far off city, or wait for a high-profile designer to come back to them with next season\u2019s orders.\u201cWe\u2019re tech-led, but impact-focussed,\u201d say both Sanchit and Maneet, at different points in the conversation, adding that their aim is to have more regular incomes for the skilled artisans, as well as bat for better wages.One more advantage of streamlining their order and inventory data? With their order histories, Lal10\u2019s designers have already mapped Spring/Summer trends for 2020, and with their Cluster Champions, are currently busy working to take that on \u2014 eight months in advance.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nForever young with Wolfenstein: Youngblood\n\n",
      "Updated: August 5, 2019 16:45 IST\rPublished: August 5, 2019 16:45 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/forever-young-with-wolfenstein-youngblood/article28822689.ece",
      "\nScreengrab from the game \u00a0 Wolfenstein has always been the pinnacle of Nazi-slaying interactive games. The melancholic, arthouse-like story, the action-packed first-person shooter (FPS) mechanics and other aspects came together to provide us some of the most memorable gaming moments this decade. Now, two strong female protagonists are introduced in Wolfenstein: Youngblood to push the series forward.Every Let\u2019s-Player out there is currently streaming their own game-plays, just proving how truly binge-game-worthy the franchise is... wouldn\u2019t you want to know what the world would be like in the aftermath of a hypothetical Axis victory? The first franchise release was in 1981 with Castle Wolfenstein.Wolfenstein: YoungbloodDeveloper : MachineGames, Arkane StudiosPublisher: Bethesda SoftworksPrice: \u20b92499 for Playstation 4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo SwitchSet 20 years after 2017\u2019s The New Colossus (the eighth main entry in the series), the hero of the Wolfenstein games, William BJ Blazkowicz, who\u2019s living a peaceful life raising his twin teenage daughters, has suddenly disappeared without a trace. The daughters, Jessica and Sophia, against their mother\u2019s wishes, wield armours and weapons, battle against Nazis and search for their legendary father. What ensues is a violent coming-of-age story. The last two Wolfenstein games set up an incredible alternate universe, where Nazis win the Second World War and have progressed through the decades that follow, creating war machines, power suits and exploring space. This alternative history that plays out is the most compelling thing about the game. While the story is not as good as the first two games, it does have a few touching moments. Like the opening scene, wherein the sisters get their first Nazi kill that leads to bouts of retching and high-fives. \n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab from the game \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a friend along, Youngblood can be immensely entertaining (and mildly annoying in spurts). Playing as either of the sisters, you can leap high and come crashing down on unsuspecting Nazis or turn invisible and take them down. Tag-teaming against some of the monstrous mechanical enemies with unpronounceable names is exhilarating. Yet, there are annoying gates and boxes that you have to open with your partner. While playing with a friend is certainly fun, you can also set the other sister to AI, and play a solo game which is a bit less tedious. But good luck trying to find the solo game option in the convoluted menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab from the game \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game is just a series of levels that requires you to travel across occupied Paris with catacombs serving as hub areas. Levels usually have a main quest to accomplish, but along the way, you get several instructions to carry out various errands. But earning money and XP to upgrade weapons and trying them out is fun, combining a first-person shooter with role-playing mechanics to keep things interesting.Wolfenstein: Youngblood may not have the narrative essence of the first two games, and it may be riddled with micro-transactions and menus, but what it does have is snappy first-person action, with weapons that pack an incredible punch and two daring teen heroes who are not afraid to kick Nazi butt.If you\u2019ve finished the game-play and are feeling a little withdrawal, fear not: Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot will keep the war-monger in you satisfied.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAnnie Yujin's passion for farming turns her a YouTube sensation\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/passion-for-farming-turned-her-a-youtube-sensation/article28810076.ece",
      "It was in 2012 that Annie Yujin uploaded all her amateur pictures and photographs on plants and farming on YouTube.A simple advice from her elder brother Yujin Bobby, who runs a web-designing and hosting firm, to protect her farming photos and videos from hard disk breakdown was what brought her aboard the video-streaming website. An encouraging comment under one of those videos motivated Ms. Yujin to take her hobby more seriously. Seven years down the line, Ms. Yujin, who lives with her husband Stephen and teenaged son Stefin at Vytilla, is now a minor celebrity. Her YouTube channel on farming, Krishi Lokam, has a subscription base of more than three lakh. And YouTube recently felicitated her in the city as one of the most prolific Malayalam content creators on farming. \u201cIt was a huge surprise and my first impulse was to turn down the invitation from YouTube as it also featured an interaction with the media. I was always in love with plants and farming but never in my wildest of dreams did I imagine that it would one day bring me such recognition,\u201d Ms. Yujin gushed. From posting short videos shot in an amateurish way in the past, she has now moved on to lengthier videos, shot and edited in a much more professional way, with the help of editing software and better camera.  Ms. Yujin now posts once in two days and the topic is often dictated by the suggestions made by her legions of subscribers in the comments section of her channel. \u201cThe posts are mostly about farming and visits to farms and interactions with farmers. Till now, such visits were restricted to the immediate neighbourhood of my husband\u2019s home at Angamaly where we stay during weekends. Now I want to expand the scope of such visits and help farmers earn better income through my channel,\u201d said Ms. Yujin. That her husband is also passionate about farming also helped her. She would have dedicated more time to her passion had she not been entrusted with running her brother\u2019s office in Kochi since he suffers from muscular dystrophy.But that has not stopped her from running another YouTube channel \u2014 Tips for Happy Life \u2014 which commands over six lakh subscribers. Though it has more subscribers than Krishi Lokam, YouTube finds the former as more unique since popular Malayalam content on farming is rare. Ms. Yujin nowadays earn seizable income and YouTube shares 55% of the ad revenue with the creator.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "He may lack the poise of Guardians of the Galaxy superhero Rocket Raccoon but this little adventurer is becoming an Internet star in his own right.

The whole rescue mission lasted two hours.\u201cWe rescue citizens both big and small!!!\u201d tweeted the Newton fire department. Raccoons, which are omnivorous, live around two to three years in the wild.They are known for their strange fixation with \u201cwashing\u201d their food and hands, a ritual believed by scientists to be related to their innate tendency to forage for food near water sources.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

However, in the recent times, most parents are shifting to pre-lacteal feeds, which can have an affect on the growth of the newborn. Hence, in order to spread awareness about importance of breastfeeding, we have developed an app that will be provide all the necessary information to the mothers at their fingertips,\u201d said Dr. Sunitha.\u201cThe app contains explainer videos about the nature and importance of breastfeeding, pre-natal care and the requisite protein intake for the mothers as well. The app will also be of use to nurses, since they happen to the be the first lactation consultants after a pregnancy. They can inform the mother about the immediate steps that have to be taken in order to ensure that her child is healthy,\u201d said Dr. Sreedevi.The app, which is yet to be named, was launched on the occasion of the annual Breastfeeding week that is celebrated by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. The motto of this programme was to ensure awareness about the importance of breastfeeding to the newborns for a period of six months.Vellampalli Srinivas, Minister of Endowments, and Malladi Vishnu, MLA, Vijayawada Central, who were the chief guests at the programme, said it was extremely important that the newborn babies received mother\u2019s milk in order to develop strong immunity.\u201cThis government has given significant priority to the health sector in the Budget and will ensure that the awareness is spread to all the corners of the State,\u201d said Mr. Srinivas.

Multiple studies over the past few years \u2014 the latest from Canada, published in JAMA Paediatrics \u2014 have concluded that there is a positive link between the amount of time spent on social media and the rise in depressive symptoms.And yet, it is online that the above mentioned people have found a listening ear; on It\u2019s Okay to Talk website, they can give accounts of their experiences, and hope it will echo with someone around the world. Started by Sangath NGO, co-founded by psychiatrist Dr Vikram Patel, the initiative is one of many that have appeared online, which allows people to discuss their state of mind.Why not a real-life support group? Why the Internet? \u201cBecause that\u2019s where people are. The youth are online, looking for more information on mental health. So we need to provide a solution where it can be accessible to them,\u201d summarises Sweta Pal, coordinator of It\u2019s Okay to Talk.\u201cMoreover, on the Internet, you need not filter your thoughts. It\u2019s just a stranger you have never seen,\u201d says Bhavika Mehta.The 19-year-old is the latest to join this batch of online mental health support pages. Last year, the Delhi woman started her Instagram page, The Happy Company (@to.a.happier.world), to provide a safe space for people dealing with mental health issues.Bhavika encourages people to drop a DM when they need to talk, and she or one of her volunteers will get in touch with them for a conversation. \u201cBefore depression becomes that, there is a lot of build up. Keeping those feelings of melancholy and loneliness to yourself can trigger it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite her relative inexperience, within a month, her page was getting mentioned by artists and actors such as Eisha Chopra and Hitha Chandrashekar, sharing their own battles. She currently works with 30 volunteers, each handling around two conversations per day.\u201cWe remind them that we are just a bunch of students, and ask if they are all right talking to us. Then we also provide a database of counsellors, therapists, and professionals,\u201d she says.Similar is the case of Mental Health Talks India, run by Adishi Gupta, 24, and Ayushi Khemka, 25. While the duo primarily puts up posts on social media opening up dialogues, it also invites people to share their stories of survival and post them. \u201cEven today, we receive about four to five messages, not just as DMs, but emails too. Once, there was a person who wasn\u2019t comfortable speaking over text, so we did a conference call with her for over an hour,\u201d says Ayushi, adding, \u201cMostly, they just need someone to talk to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t being exposed to people\u2019s struggles daily affect their own mental state, considering they lack training as psychologists? \u201cI myself go to a therapist,\u201d reveals Adishi, \u201cSo if there are days when I am spiralling, I let Ayushi handle the majority of work.\u201d And vice versa.On the plus side, their youth makes them more relatable. The people on these pages are generally between the ages of 15 and 30: teenagers in college, people in their 20s, working their first jobs and so on. \u201cThe topics we get most often are stress due to toxic relationships, and work,\u201d she says.Sweta reveals that her team has analysed the stories they have collected on It\u2019s Okay to Talk, over two years, to publish a paper on young Indians and mental health, in BMJ Open. The common themes that stood out were feelings of loneliness, combined with a desire to help others break the stigma.For 24-year-old artist Sonkasha Iyengar, the Internet is a space for long conversations and listening. Bullied through her years in school, and therefore unable to connect with the people around her \u2018in real life\u2019, she would look forward to coming back home, and logging onto the Internet.\u201cI started blogging when I was 12 and made a lot of friends from the blogging community,\u201d she recalls, adding how online she didn\u2019t have to put on a face, and pretend to be someone she wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, a popular presence with 13k followers, Sonaksha (@sonaksha) regularly asks her followers\u2019 questions, through Instagram \u2018stories\u2019, addressing their many concerns. In a somewhat similar, but more crowd-sourced way, digital artist Indu Harikumar has put out calls for personal stories about people\u2019s experiences, to collate them, present them artistically online, and create a safe space so that there is more awareness about things we don\u2019t talk about in our daily lives.Her campaign #100TinderTales threw light on the nuances of what one would otherwise dismiss as hookup culture, while #Indentitty invited people to submit photos of their bust (in whatever degree of undress they were comfortable in). Accompanied with stories, it started a conversation about socio-cultural issues with regard to a woman\u2019s breasts.If not for the free space that is the Internet, none of this would have been possible. The Gen-Z Bhavika puts it best: \u201cAwareness came not through schools, but online \u2014 nobody talks about mental health in classrooms! But the Internet is a force that has shaped us.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Recently, social media was aghast to see the video of an Indian family caught stealing accessories from a hotel abroad. The viral video showed they had lifted much more than mini-toiletries; hotel authorities found ceramic liquid soap dispensers, hairdryer, towels and more in their bags.Most frequent travellers were angry and posted the video mentioning why some countries \u2018do not like Indian tourists\u2019, and others criticised the family for bringing \u2018disgrace to Indian tourists\u2019.Seizing the opportunity, ixigo \u2014 a Delhi-based e-commerce website for travel and hotel booking \u2014 has shared an old video (shot in June 2018) that explained what can be taken from a hotel and what shouldn\u2019t even be attempted. While it is understood that mini- toiletries can be taken, many travellers are also known to pack bath and face towels while checking out. The 2.10-minute video serves as a tutorial for those who are in the habit of packing things that are not theirs.The video is now being shared with #HotelConfession. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nDragon Quest Builders 2 review: Joy of creating new worlds\n\n",
      "Updated: July 30, 2019 13:15 IST\rPublished: July 30, 2019 13:15 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/dragon-quest-builders-2-review-joy-of-creating-new-worlds/article28756926.ece",
      "It\u2019s easy to see Dragon Quest Builders as just another Minecraft clone, even as it proved that the series can combine two genres with great success. It married the Lego-like block-building with role-playing mechanics and the result was magic. Dragon Quest Builders 2 builds on the premise and adds multi-player options for good measure.The Builders sequel takes place in the same realm as Dragon Quest II, where a cult known as the Children of Hargon have captured all the Builders in a nefarious bid to stop the creation of all things. You play as one such builder who escapes the prison ship. You end up on a mysterious archipelago and befriend Malroth, an amnesiac stranger. Everything about Dragon Quest Builders 2 is delightful. The story motivates you to explore, build and complete other quests that will eventually restore the villagers\u2019 islands to their former glory. The expansive realm, teeming with quirky non-player characters (NPC), adds more excitement to the game.At its core, the game is all about exploring and searching for materials in the hostile outdoors and then building with what you find. What you want to build is entirely upto you. The game\u2019s design will get your creative juices flowing.You will need to journey across the main island and hop onto the neighbouring ones to find building materials (but there are many monsters along the way). Exploring is a lot of fun when you add gliding into the mix. Doing quests for the NPCs are fun. You can also recruit them to help you. The initial phase of the game will tutor you in building, collecting materials and the economics of the realm. Where the game lacks big time is in the combat, which is a shame because that\u2019s an area which Dragon Quest games have always excelled in. In Builders 2, real-time combat is frustrating and will make you stay away from enemy encounters because the fighting is tedious. We hope Omega Force really does take some active steps to fix this over a few patches. These little niggles aside, the game is excellent, even in multi-player, which mostly works with you jumping into other people\u2019s realms and helping them build their creations. To enjoy the game better, you might need to get over the impression of it being just a building game. Annoying combats aside, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is an excellent, quirky and creative game. If you want to quest and build on-the-go, you could opt for the Nintendo Switch version.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHow facial recognition technology is redefining biological data\n\n",
      "Updated: July 30, 2019 19:34 IST\rPublished: July 30, 2019 12:57 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-facial-recognition-works-in-your-device/article28756854.ece",
      "\nThe solution FR should be limited to one\u2019s own device, and not up on any server or cloud\n\u00a0 \u2018Is this you?\u2019 The Facebook algorithm ventured to ask my friend the other day, once again showing her a photo of her sister, elder to her by five years \u2014 the duo look startlingly similar, but not identical. The algorithm\u2019s constant confusion between the two sisters is not just a source of mirth for my friend, but also indicative of a deeper concern: how smart is facial recognition and how much power does this technology deserve?Most recently, the massive appeal of Wireless Lab\u2019s FaceApp, an application that showed strangely accurate representations of how you might look 50 years down the line, raised the debate around facial recognition again. \u201cBillions of people are handing over their facial data to one company!\u201d \u201cPshhh, they have all that data already, so what\u2019s the point now!\u201d are the opposing points of view thrown around across the privacy debate wall.But while India\u2019s netizens were discussing this, the National Crime Records Bureau has proposed that a centralised Automated Facial Recognition System be created. It claims that this will help the police keep a repository of data on suspects, captured, from among other sources, CCTV footage. Even more recently, Delhi and Hyderabad airports have launched face-recognition systems for granting entry.\n\n\n\nAutomated Facial Recognition System and citizens' privacy \n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/797uX2zx-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\n\u00a0What Facial Recognition (FR) technology essentially does is to \u201cread\u201d the geometry of your face and its biometrics: the distance between your eyes, between your forehead and chin, between your ears. This facial data can then be used to match with an image already available in the repository of the agency in question, in order to identify a person.So why be concerned? First off, there is no guarantee that FR works accurately. In American cities such as San Francisco, the heart of technological developments, Somerville and Oakland, the government has banned the use of FR technology, due to its inaccuracies. There have also been reports that the mis-identification of minorities was higher than Caucasian communities.\u201cThe Metropolitan police in London \u2014 a city with a high density of CCTV cameras \u2014 commissioned an independent study of FR, and found that the software was wrong four out of five times,\u201d says Apar Gupta, Executive Director at Internet Freedom Foundation, Delhi.\u201cBut even considering FR works well, it is the turning of public spaces into policed zones of conduct that is worrying. It puts people under perpetual watch, resulting in possible moral and social policing,\u201d he says, quoting examples of young couples and minorities.In 2017, the Supreme Court, in a historic judgement, declared privacy to be a fundamental right. However, there is a clause that it can be overridden in case of a reasonable public purpose \u2014 such as safety. \u201cUnder the guise of women\u2019s safety, women may be more policed in a paternal sense, where their liberties are restricted,\u201d he says.Moreover, as things stand right now, we don\u2019t even have legal framework to rely on, in case there is misuse of our facial data. There is no surveillance oversight by judiciary, nor is there a data protection authority which makes sure that facial information gathered is not put to use for other purposes. (This column previously spoke about deep-fakes (face swapping); something that is assisted by FR.)\u201cWe call it the privacy paradox,\u201d says Apar. People don\u2019t mind sharing their data as long as it makes life convenient for them \u2014 unlocking phones, saving browsing history and passwords\u2026 But for that data to be used by other parties? How much consent has been given is not clear.People can consent to their facial data being gathered, but that consent doesn\u2019t extend to being sold or used without their knowledge and agreement. \u201cThe only framework in place currently is through a privacy policy, which is too clunky, verbose and inaccessible for the majority,\u201d he points out. Instead, he feels, facial recognition should be limited to one\u2019s own device, and not up on any server or cloud. So when agreeing to share facial data, ask yourself this: would you share your signature or fingerprint with just anyone? And then, use the same logic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nThe risks of booking for vacations online\n\n",
      "Updated: August 3, 2019 14:32 IST\rPublished: July 30, 2019 12:12 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/the-risks-of-booking-for-vacations-online/article28756498.ece",
      "Priyanka Verma* was browsing online for home-stay options in Coonoor and called one hotel to seek details. In less than an hour, she found her mobile phone flooded with photos and messages from other service providers she hadn\u2019t contacted. Priyanka realised her number had been passed on by the staff at the first home-stay property she had enquired about. Later, to confirm her booking, she was asked to send her identity proof to a WhatsApp group that could be viewed by other vacationers at the home-stay. This underlines the lack of information protection in online holiday booking, which sometimes can result in loss of money. To put things in perspective, let\u2019s turn to some stats. According to a report from the British travel agents, Action Fraud and Get Safe Online, more than 5,000 people have reported being victims of online booking scams in 2018 in the United Kingdom, with an average financial loss of \u00a31,380 per person. The numbers have increased from 2017, which witnessed 4,382 victims lose a total of \u00a36.7m.In India, we haven\u2019t come across any major study of travel-related scams, but such horror stories are reported. Just over the weekend, over 500 Haj pilgrims lost \u20b915 crores, allegedly to proprietors of Mumbai-based travel agency Alfa Enterprises. To make matters worse, the tour operator dropped off the radar on July 8.Worth the warinessBe wary of any unsolicited messages, calls or emails when you are planning a holiday. Double-check the authenticity of such mails before you get into a longer discussion where you have to reveal bank details and account number. Keep all communication booking on trusted platforms.Always do transactions from a secure device. Even your smart phone needs to have security tools installed, so that if you lose your phone the device can help you locate it. Use security protection while browsing websites, so that it can help identify malicious sites.Before booking a property, read up reviews from verified trip advisors about the place, stay and other features.Try to keep your digital activities to a minimum. Avoid using a public WiFi to download images or any other document. If you have to conduct transactions on a public Wi-Fi connection, use a virtual private network (VPN) to keep your connection secure.Compiled with inputs from Anindita Mishra, McAfee\u2019s Cybermum in IndiaSo, what are some of the common online scams? You booked a dream villa by the sea, but you arrive to find that there is no such place and the website that advertised it has disappeared.Booking online is simple, but one needs to be wary of websites that come up with offers that sound too good to be true. Booking frauds are more common during the peak holidaying season.\u201cAt the start of the holiday season, we see advertisements that promise holiday-goers the sky,\u201d says Sanjar Imam, president of the non-profit Karnataka Tourism Forum. He says there is no such thing as a free lunch and it\u2019s all built into the cost. The other common complaint is a mismatch between promise and delivery, such as the website advertising that the property is near the beach and you find out a whole new interpretation of the word \u2018near\u2019.\u201cHave a little bit of due diligence to check the background of the company,\u201d he says.A McAfee and HomeAway research involving 8,000 respondents across eight countries, including the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, France and Germany, says that 54% worry about their identity being stolen while booking and purchasing travel and accommodation online. More than 25% do not check the authenticity of a website before booking a holiday. More than a quarter of holiday fraud victims have been scammed after spotting \u2018a great offer\u2019. Other findings of the study are 46.3% of holiday scam victims say they realise they have been taken up a garden path only when they turn up at their holiday rental to find the booking isn\u2019t actually valid.Another red flag is being asked to pay by bank transfer. If someone asks you to pay outside of the site, be more vigilant, says Amit Damani, co-founder, Vista Rooms.Some scammers distract people to other sites, tempting them with better offers. While online transaction is much safer, it must be done after double checking, he says.Experts in the travel industry say that apart from creating awareness among holidayers, a redressal mechanism would also help.OYO Hotels and Homes has an in-app SOS button feature that enables guests experiencing any emergency situation to receive the assistance of on-ground hotel staff, a trained 24x7 OYO Safety Response Team (SRT) and also initiate a call with the local law enforcement authorities.The horror stories are rampant. But international campaigns are at the frontline. Earlier this year, industry-wide UK-based Secure Our Systems, spearheaded by Prevention of Fraud in Travel (PROFIT), aims to combat the growing menace of cybercrime relating to travel companies. Before you express your scepticism, the announcement comes just ahead of the launch of an industry \u2018blacklist\u2019 of known travel fraudsters, part of new anti-fraud system Fraud Intelligence Network (FIN), which is also being developed by PROFIT and will enable the reporting of travel fraud and vet job applicants.FIN is a data-driven venture which enables its users to manage high-risk bookings, share data with other industry members, gain intelligence from fraud data, and report occurrences of fraud to the police. There\u2019s also a community aspect in which like-minded individuals are put in contact with each other, creating a forum for discussion with security experts.*Name changed to protect identityYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "If you are seeing an unusual number of ads on your Android phone, chances are your phone has been taken over by Agent Smith.The malware, which derives its name from the antagonist of the Wachowski Brothers\u2019 cult trilogy The Matrix, is currently being tracked by cyber crime agencies across the world. Earlier this week, the Maharashtra Cyber department issued an advisory cautioning users against the malware, which can silently embed itself into any cell phone.Officials said that the malware is named after Hugo Weaving\u2019s character in the trilogy because it exhibits similar behaviour. In the movie, Agent Smith can convert anyone in the Matrix \u2013 a virtual reality \u2013 into a clone of himself. Similarly, the malware can impersonate any android-based app and enter the cell phone. \n\n\nBeware of Agent Smith, an Android phone malware\n\n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/D4FNwVMi-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\n\u00a0Calling it \u2018scary\u2019, officials from the Maharashtra Cyber department said that Agent Smith takes over apps on an Android phone, including popular and widely used ones like WhatsApp, without changing its hash value \u2013 a unique code which is regarded to be the integrity of any computer file or programme, which makes it all the more challenging to detect.Sources said Agent Smith seems to have been designed by Chinese hackers, although this is still being verified.\u201cThe only signs of a phone being infected are if the number of ads you see suddenly rise significantly, and if the ads you are seeing have nothing to do with your regular browsing habits. Currently, it seems that Agent Smith is only infiltrating apps with the intention of throwing up advertisements for other apps,\u201d an official said.However, the officer added, once the malware has control over a cell phone, it can do anything, including stealing banking details or other sensitive data, which can be misused in a variety of ways.\u201cUsers are advised against downloading third party apps to avoid falling prey to Agent Smith and to keep updating their operating system. Also, if one sees the signs of their device being infected, they should immediately do a factory reset,\u201d said Special Inspector General of Police Brijesh Singh, Maharashtra Cyber.According to a recent report released by Checkpoint, a private cyber security firm, Agent Smith has taken over 25 million devices around the world, including India, Indonesia and the U.S.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nThis Instagram account has teamed up with Mental Health Talks India to highlight positive change in film narratives \n",
      "Updated: July 27, 2019 13:27 IST\rPublished: July 27, 2019 13:27 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/humans-of-cinema-instagram/article28730704.ece",
      "If one came across a page called Humans Of Cinema, it\u2019d be fair to assume that there\u2019ll be a flurry of posts about film industry folks. But 23-year-old Harshit Bansal from Delhi took the idea beyond the predictable and caught netizens\u2019 attention in early May when he announced \u2018Mental Health Talks x Humans Of Cinema;\u2019 a project inviting film enthusiasts to talk about the moments in cinema which helped them through tough times. The series aims at highlighting the positive power of cinema. The link-up with Mental Health Talks India was serendipitous for Harshit. \u201cThe idea of correlating cinema with mental health came from a very personal space for me,\u201d he explains, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very personal relationship with films. But two years ago, when my mental health was at its worst, watching my favourite film or TV show used to make me feel better. I think films have the potential to evoke emotions and induce empathy like no other medium in the world, which is why it becomes such a powerful tool of self-help as well as rehabilitation for people. Eventually, however, it\u2019s important to remember that films are only a temporary medium of escape and professional help should be sought when necessary.\u201d The future of Humans Harshit considers the \u2018Humans Of..\u2019 concept to be one of the most important things to have happened to society in the last decade. \u201cThe Humans Of pages from around the world have successfully acted as flag-bearers of positivity and a feeling of unity in an otherwise negative social media and an increasingly polarising society. I think this shows that stories and experiences unite people and make them forget about their differences, and I hope these pages are able to keep doing that in the future as well. After all, even when everything is lost, it\u2019s the stories which survive.\u201dMental health narratives are prevalent in the series, through a sweet letter to Robin Williams\u2019 character John Keating in 1989\u2019s Dead Poets Society or Alia Bhatt\u2019s Ananya in 2014\u2019s 2 States. It\u2019s worth noting many film characters tap into the mental health space in one way or another. \u201cA lack of professional/technical understanding of mental health is something that bothers me sometimes,\u201d Harshit elaborates, \u201cCinema Therapy is a subject of study in itself, and is used by many therapists as a part of psychotherapy.\u201d While his profession doesn\u2019t lie in the film realm (he co-owns artist merchandiser Frankly Wearing), he considers Humans Of Cinema to be more than just a passion project. He recalls a post about Manjari Phadnis\u2019 Meghna from 2008\u2019s Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Naa. \u201cI really didn\u2019t make much of Meghna and always felt like her character hadn\u2019t been done justice in an otherwise well-written film. But in this specific story, the cinephile used instances from her own life to point out that letting Jai go was in itself an act of healing for her and was the most appropriate resolution to the character.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA tribute to Robin Williams \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what of global cinema? Harshit says he\u2019d love to up the diversity of the film discourses across Humans Of Cinema, adding, \u201cI also plan to share stories from non-Hindi Indian films as well as foreign language films in the immediate future. As OTT platforms are slowly becoming important parts of our lives and people are keen on exploring meaningful and impactful cinema from around the world, I think it's important for me as someone with this kind of reach to encourage that pattern.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "Most of us spend the moments before dozing off at night scrolling through our social media accounts or reading about the happenings of the day across the world. However, most doctors opine that this affects the quality and number of hours of our sleep. Here are some apps that will help us sleep better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep CycleThis smart alarm clock tracks your sleep patterns from bedtime till morning and creates a detailed analysis with the app. It generates daily sleep graphs, detailed sleep statistics and carefully selected alarm melodies, which will help you wake up without the shock of a loud alarm. The sleep statistics will inform you how deep your sleep was, and how to improve it. You can also create a customisable wake-up window of up to 90 minutes. There are sleep notes which will inform you how drinking coffee, eating late or working out affects your night\u2019s rest. (http://bit.ly/2y4uNTN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep as AndroidDo you need lullabies to fall asleep? Then, this app might work for you. Not only does it track your sleep, it also plays nature lullabies such as sea, chants, whales, and so on, with binaural tones for you to rest well. It has contact-less ultrasonic sleep tracking capabilities which will ensure you don\u2019t need to keep your phone on the bed for it to track your sleep. It also records your sleep talk and snoring so that you can track them. Apart from that, it tracks sleep respiration such as sleep phaser, oximetry or sonar.

It tracks your nightly sleep periods with whatever gaps that happened in between. Upon tracking your sleep, the app creates at least 25 graphs mentioning different aspects of your sleep. It allows you to save screenshots of these graphs and statistics in case you want to share the same with your medical professionals, family or friends.

      "\n\nThe man behind #GoodVibesOnly\n\n",
      "Updated: July 26, 2019 16:29 IST\rPublished: July 26, 2019 16:29 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/books/vex-king-the-man-behind-goodvibesonly-now-has-a-book-out/article28721984.ece",
      "We don\u2019t know much about Vex King. Yet we know everything about him. We\u2019re not privy to his real name, but we know he\u2019s had a rough childhood: he lost his father early to tuberculosis, and his biggest inspiration is his mother. We know that despite missing each other a bunch of times, Vex and his now wife got together nearly a decade ago. The social-media \u2018mind coach\u2019, with his big follower base (of 367k on Instagram; 40k on Facebook; 55.5k on Twitter), popularised the hashtag #GoodVibesOnly. He says he lives on the \u201coutskirts of London\u201d, still holding on to whatever he can about himself. It\u2019s not like his posts demand an overshare; a lot of them are in fact generic messages about self-love, self-acceptance, but in context of his longer captions, they feed into the online world\u2019s thirst for \u2018authentic\u2019, \u2018raw\u2019 content.\n\n\n\n\n\nVex\u2019s popularity is testament to the fact that self-care is the new self-help. While a lot of us might have grown up with Stephen Covey\u2019s 7 Habits series, and somewhat older readers remember the classic Self Help by Samuel Smiles, the push there was on how you could be useful, productive, efficient. And now there\u2019s Good Vibes, Good Life: How Self-Love is the Key to Unlocking Your Greatness, by Vex King. The book, a handy, palm-sized Bible of sorts for the millennial and post-millennial to navigate life, is a stark departure from the traditional self-help. It tells us to slow down, take stock of internal and external developments, and be kinder to ourselves. If you\u2019ve dwelt on your life even a little bit, you\u2019ll find yourself nodding as you read along. At the same time though, you\u2019re also left wondering at the obviousness of it all. \u201cStaying true to yourself\u201d, \u201cChoose real friendships\u201d, \u201cCheck your own behaviour\u201d, and \u201cOne thought is all it takes,\u201d are some of the book\u2019s chapters. In an email interview, Vex talked about why he felt the need to do a book despite massive online following, about #GoodVibesOnly that was his original claim to fame, and the ways in which we are asked to cope with life. Edited excerpts.It must have been around 2012. I was learning a lot about vibration and energy, and realised that higher states of vibrations can help you manifest a good life. Therefore, I thought this phrase would be good to promote. I decided to start a Twitter page after the movement and it grew to over 200,000 followers very quickly. I then decided to push it on other platforms and slowly, I began seeing more people use it.There\u2019s only so much you can say on social media. I want this book to serve as a life guide \u2014 so people could pick it up any time they needed a bit of wisdom, positive reminders or an energetic boost. Nothing compares to physically having a book available at hand where all the information you need is in one place, and easy to navigate through.\n\n\n\n\n\nA literary agent saw how much impact my Instagram posts were making, and so she approached me to ask me if I was interested in writing a book. At this point, I already had a manuscript ready to self-publish. The planning of the book took me two months. The writing took me two weeks. The editing took months. The whole process took one and half years, from start to finish.The reason I actually wrote the section is because I get at least 100 messages a week discussing how much their family is hurting them and not knowing what to do. Many are young girls claiming severe abuse. This topic is always tricky to write about, but is much needed. We are told that family is everything and we should put blood first, but often they can be the biggest reason for mental health problems. The general feedback I\u2019ve got is gratitude \u2014 a lot of people said it was a much-needed topic to discuss.In the office, we have to be self-aware so we can recognise the difference between something that is unhealthy for us and something that requires action. If your manager asks you to work harder, they may be asking because you haven\u2019t put enough effort to reach your potential. To frame this as a toxic demand comes from a perspective of entitlement, instead of understanding you need to and can do more. However, if your manager asks you to work harder in an unjust and malicious manner, you may rightly identify this as a behaviour you do not need to settle for. While this is not always the most practical advice, I do feel your gut (that calm sense of knowing which is not triggered by your conditioning) always knows best. The truth is, we\u2019ll never really know. But, it\u2019s the most empowering way to live life, otherwise we will constantly feel sad when life doesn\u2019t manifest exactly as we imagined,  as we wanted it to. That\u2019s why detachment is so important. To retain happiness, you must let go and have faith that what\u2019s meant to be a part of your life, will eventually be a part of it, even if it isn\u2019t how you initially imagined it.Good Vibes, Good Life: How Self-Love is the Key to Unlocking Your Greatness, \u20b9399, Hay House IndiaYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Over 2,100 URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) were blocked on social media platforms in the first six months of 2019, Parliament was informed on Wednesday. A total of 633, 1,385 and 2,799 URLs were ordered for blocking in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.

      "\nFacebook brought in almost $56 billion in revenue in 2018.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to announce on Wednesday that Facebook has agreed to a sweeping settlement of significant allegations it mishandled user privacy and pay $5 billion, two people briefed on the matter said.As part of the settlement, Facebook will agree to create a board committee on privacy and will agree to new executive certifications that users' privacy is being properly protected, the people said.Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will have to certify every three months that the company is properly safeguarding user privacy, a person briefed on the matter said.Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to announce a related settlement with Facebook for around $100 million over allegations it failed to disclose risks to investors over its privacy practices. The Wall Street Journal reported the SEC settlement earlier.The Post also reported the FTC also plans to allege Facebook provided insufficient information to about 30 million users about a facial recognition tool, an issue identified earlier by Consumer Reports.The settlement comes amid growing concern among U.S. policymakers about the privacy of online users and have sparked calls for new legal protections in Congress. Separately, the U.S. Justice Department said late Tuesday it is launching a broad antitrust probe into the competitive practices of large tech companies like Facebook.Two people briefed on the matter confirmed the Post report the FTC will not require Facebook to admit guilt as part of the settlement. The settlement will need to be approved by a federal judge and will contain other significant allegations of privacy lapses, the people said.The fine will mark the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.The FTC confirmed in March 2018 it had opened an investigation into allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator and then widened to include other privacy allegations.A person briefed on the matter said the phone number, facial recognition and two-factor authentication issues were not part of the initial Cambridge Analytica probe.Some in Congress have criticized the reported $5 billion penalty, noting Facebook in 2018 had $55.8 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in net income. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, said last week the fine should be $50 billion.While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies. Facebook is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.But the company's core business has proven resilient, as Facebook blew past earnings estimates in the past two quarters. Facebook is set to report earnings on July 24.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "The Japanese Role-Playing Game (JRPG) is a dying breed of gaming. Yes, there is a resurgence nowadays, as we see games such as Persona 5 and Yakuza series blend that genre into something different. At the very end of that era, though, there were fantastic games... and The Last Remnant remains one of them.What\u2019s it about?Much like Final Fantasy XII\u2019s deep political storyline, The Last Remnant takes place in a world about to go to war for a bunch of artefacts known as Remnants. As kingdoms clash, you assume the role of Rush Sykes, who leads a peaceful life until war hits home, and before he knows it, he is thrust into a tangled web while searching for his kidnapped sister.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab of The Last Remnant Remastered\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tale of The Last Remnant is masterfully told, capturing the spirit of the genre and melding it into a compelling view of war. The stage is massive, and at times you just get the feeling the cast of characters are cardboard cut-outs to serve the storyline, rather than an interesting collection of personalities.The Last Remnant RemasteredDeveloper + Publisher: Square EnixPrice: \u20b91399 (Approx) for Nintendo SwitchOne thing is for certain: the game is extremely well-directed, and with the remaster, the old complaints of texture and graphical issues are gone.How does it play?The Last Remnant is more dense with menus than your average JRPG. Battles group you into \u2018unions\u2019 of characters facing off against enemy unions. Governing those is a morale meter as your units either have to overwhelm enemies or get overwhelmed. Overall, once you get a hang of it, it is a surprisingly deep and fun game of chess where the tides turn quickly \u2014 you have to think tactically as you move your mini army into position.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab of The Last Remnant Remastered\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get it? While the battle system feels like an all-out war, the rest of the game is very JRPG-like as you traverse the globe and towns speaking to people and completing various quests.Moving into a quirkier realm, large set-piece-toting action games or intriguing 100-hour-plus RPGs are great, but there are times when you want something simpler in which to jump into. Enter My Friend Pedro: it takes the bullet-time games of the \u201800\u2019s and creates an addictive physics-based puzzle game, which is violent and yet relaxing at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab of My Friend Pedro \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it about?Bananas are the core of the game, so much so your guide through the game is a sentient banana. My Friend Pedro is basically a remake of a flash game by Adult Swim, which d\u00e9buted in 2014. A loose set of levels tied together by a threadbare story, with one mission, to let you have as much fun as you can.How does it play? My Friend PedroDeveloper: DeadToast EntertainmentPublisher: Devolver DigitalPrice: \u20b91399 (Approx) for Xbox One and PlayStation 4Retaining its quirk My Friend Pedro is definitely an engager. A side-scroller letting you control a surprisingly agile gunman in slow motion as you obliterate enemies in a bunch of stylish ways. Levels are set with devious puzzles and encourage you to think before you blast them, to ensure you get maximum points; that is, after all, the point. From split-shooting to optimising your path to ensure maximum mayhem, the game will keep you fixated on getting a perfect score.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreengrab of My Friend Pedro \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get it?A perfect game to pick up and play in short bursts, My Friend Pedro is aptly named, as this game will be your best friend on those short train rides or those waiting lines at the dentist\u2019s.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWorld Lipstick Month: How lipstick has brought the world of beauty and tech together \n",
      "Updated: July 24, 2019 12:17 IST\rPublished: July 23, 2019 11:50 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/lipstick-and-technology-not-just-a-pretty-phase/article28671575.ece",
      "\nRepresentational image of a lipstick wearer\n\u00a0 A smear, a swipe; the simplicity of the lipstick hasn\u2019t gone under-appreciated in the centuries observed by this little beauty gadget. According to Orbis Research, the global cosmetics market is expected to reach a market value of US$805.61 billion by 2023, a figure with way too many commas if converted to Indian rupees.In a tube with a bullet or in liquid form with a doe-foot applicator, the lipstick doesn\u2019t merely take up a little space on the vanity but also shows how technology has nurtured a relationship with the beauty industry over the past century.Think about the ergonomics of a lipstick; how the lipstick bullet is designed is reliant on technology and intense study \u2014 a factor which affects the final purchase. The tapered end of a lipstick bullet allows the wearer to apply with precision at the outer edges of the lip, and the diameter has been constructed for careful thought into the pressure during application. Browsing online for lipstick is almost as intense as browsing for a car; the look, feel and durability have to be just right\u2026 and if they aren\u2019t, well, there are thousands of alternatives to consider.Some brands offer various try-on techniques for shoppers; while Sephora India takes the try-on method further, promising \u2018natural light\u2019 in-store, the Lakm\u00e9 Makeup Pro app, lets you simply upload a picture of yourself and you can \u2018apply\u2019 the different shades of lipsticks for sale and see how they fare with your complexion. This method, which employs a dose of Artificial Intelligence to \u2018read\u2019 the customer\u2019s face, isn\u2019t exactly favoured by many shoppers for two reasons: some aren\u2019t comfortable with their picture being uploaded to any server, plus the lighting in which you take said picture may not match up with your true complexion, which can affect your purchase. And, of course, the feel of the lipstick isn\u2019t conveyed as well as when a customer physically tries it on.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample of Smashbox\u2019s 3-D printed lipstick\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Smashbox Cosmetics invited beauty enthusiasts to enjoy 3-D printed lipsticks through their #Belegendary 120 Lipstick Matching Game. The customer was allowed to choose any design of which the print would get super-imposed into a mirror compact, and you can apply the lipstick using a brush or your fingers. Not your typical lipstick bullet but the company appealed to the customisation most wanted at the time. Before companies moved to putting lipsticks into a tube and adding (and then removing) chemicals, ancient natural constructions of lipsticks were deemed the original means of manufacturing. Last year, Weibo user MianYiang Danshen went viral for her visually calming videos of creating make-up from raw materials from her backyard. For lipsticks and lipstains, she used careful proportions of rose petal dyes, white wine, honey and oil... and a lot of patience. Safe to say, without these techniques, we wouldn\u2019t have been where we are today with the cosmetics industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u2018Kiss Of Death\u2019 at New York City\u2019s KGB Museum \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to the Cold War. Lipsticks weren\u2019t only a beautification accessory small enough to fit in your clutch. Peruse history books and indulge in enough James Bond films, and it won\u2019t surprise you that lipsticks have been used as weapons. At KGB Espionage Museum in New York City, the Kiss of Death appears to be a simple lipstick in a chrome silver case, the bullet (no pun intended) itself a true red. But it\u2019s actually a single-shot, small-caliber gun. The one pictured was designed for use by KGB operatives during the Cold War, and this particular gun was confiscated at an American checkpoint in West Berlin.Then there are times lipstick-like projects don\u2019t turn out. Remember the Nokia 7280? The phone was also dubbed the \u2018lipstick phone\u2019, given its cosmetic-like appearance.An out-of-the-box creation, it was mocked relentlessly for the non-functional experience it offered. Back when gender politics seemed to be worth ignoring, the 7280 was designed \u2018with women in mind\u2019 and had a Navi spinner as a central control unit, which made the already-tiny device difficult to use with input and output.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nokia 7280 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many continue to poke fun at the Nokia 7280 for its misogynistic undertones, it\u2019s worth mentioning how unconventional mobile phone design was the \u2018must be\u2019 of early-2000s technology.The beauty vlogging industry is practically a whole economy on its own. According to a dataset by Mediakix\u2019s 2019 \u2018Influencer Marketing Survey\u2019, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022. But what happens when those numbers turn on the creators of lipsticks themselves?In May, YouTuber and entrepreneur Jaclyn Hill released her own cosmetics line and unveiled a line of lipsticks. Many fans, including those in India, placed orders. However, according to customers around the globe, many lipsticks turned out to have mold, unidentified black spots, white hairs, or uneven texture \u2014 all showcased in social media posts on Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. But it didn\u2019t stop there; the publicity-heavy space of YouTube sent Jaclyn into the frontline of a battle with trolls, angry fans and other entrepreneurs, who either pointed out or refuted the claims of a poorly-maintained lab and compromised ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeauty vlogger and entrepreneur Jaclyn Hill and one of the lipsticks received by a customer \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after the first wave of dissent, a statement was released by Jaclyn Cosmetics stating, \u201cJaclyn Cosmetics are made with cosmetic industry-standard, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compliant ingredients and are produced in an OTC (Over the Counter) compliant factory that is registered with the FDA, providing high degrees of safety standards and rigorous testing\u2026 The preservative system, material composition of the formula, and processing temperature of our lipstick does not support microbial growth and protects the product through the expiration date of May 2021.\u201dSoftware developer Ritu Shetty (26) in Gurugram, who ordered a few of the lipsticks, believes popularity in the online space can cloud one\u2019s judgement. \u201cThese lipsticks aren\u2019t \u2018budget\u2019 by any means, so you\u2019re really paying for the connection with a creator. I think online platforms such as YouTube and social media, where you can see and interact with the creator, can swell the problems and anger. If you have issues with brands that don\u2019t have that one active face you can associate with the brand, you are bound to have less of a backlash.\u201dThe infrastructures of YouTube and Instagram have helped usher in an Age of Enlightenment around beauty conscientiousness. Many can argue that were it not for these platforms, young people, whether they live in Tier 1 or Tier 3 cities, wouldn\u2019t be so keenly interested about what goes into the mass market cosmetics.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nEngendered received Rs 5 lakh cheque from empoWer, Zone Startups and a market access visit to Quebec. Presenting the award to the founder Prajakta Kuwalekar are Consul General of Quebec in India Dominic Marcotte and International Change Mentor Isabelle Dessureault. \u00a0 India has a lower share of women\u2019s contribution to GDP at 17%, compared to the global average of 37%. Sexual harassment also continues unabated, despite the presence of Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) committees in many organisations. That said, Pride Month may be over but the fight for equality in all spaces continue. A Bengaluru-based startup, Engendered, is hoping to further that. It proposes to attain gender equality through data intelligence and behaviour change. It equips companies to tackle workplace biases and, in the long term, plans to make a business case for gender inclusion. \u201cWe will be certifying companies for their gender inclusion and help them in preparing a roadmap for improvement,\u201d says Prajakta Kuwalekar, the founder and chief evangelist.To begin with, it has floated an employee rights platform where former and current employees can evaluate a company\u2019s culture by taking a simple quiz. A \u2018perception score\u2019 can be attained through this method, and a \u2018facts score\u2019 based on the available public data.\u201cIn case a company has any discrepancies between the two scores, Engendered will help bridge the gap. While we will draw a roadmap for them, we will also put them in touch with existing solution providers that can help them bring change. Meanwhile, people who are interested in joining these companies can see these scores on our website to make a better decision,\u201d she said.Engendered also proposes to provide women comprehensive data about companies to help them make better career decisions. Speaking about the paucity of open data, Ipshita Sen, co-founder and COO, says, \u201cIn the next phase, we hope to provide information like the management team\u2019s composition, facilities like flexible work timing, paternity leave and even past records of any sexual harassment cases.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIpshita Sen and Prajakta Kuwalekar from Engendered presenting to the jury their inclusion platform during the final demo of empoWer program at Bombay Stock Exchange. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted in April 2018, it has already received international recognition. It was selected as among the 15 members for empoWer, Zone Startups India\u2019s flagship initiative for women entrepreneurs. Apart from receiving \u20b95,00,000 as equity-free seed fund, it was invited by the Quebec government for a two-week-long market access trip to Quebec and Canada. They also organised B2B, B2G and ecosystem meetings for it in Montreal.The trip revealed that there is more demand for Engendered\u2019s platform in Canada. \u201cThe unemployment rate there is only around 3% and companies there are vying to hire women. The cost of employee acquisition is also high. They are open to experimenting to keep a diverse workforce in their organisation,\u201d said Kuwalekar.They are running a pilot project with Canadian companies and will also be launching their certification and employee rights platform in Canada. Going forward, Engendered is hoping to expand to tier II and tier III cities like Pune and Ahmedabad. \u201cThis is where businesses are evolving and the employees are increasingly becoming aware of their rights,\u201d said Sen. Engendered also proposes to gradually move into the gig economy sector. \u201cWe plan to do exploratory impact work from the profit we make from MNCs. We can then work for the women from the low socio-economic backgrounds,\u201d Kuwalekar said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA scene from Avengers: Infinity War. File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n The Indian imprint on Hollywood is acquiring, quite literally, new dimensions and the dazzle of special effects in films ranging from extravaganzas like Thor: The Dark World and Avengers to more intimate cinema like The Shape of Water and The Handsmaid\u2019s Tale.If it weren\u2019t for the post-credit scenes, many cinegoers would be in the dark about the number of Indians contributing to the lavishly mounted spectacle they have just watched.It takes a village, or in this case a massive industry, and Indians are increasingly a vital part of the VFX (visual effects) credits scrolling up in the darkness of a theatre.The reasons are many \u2013 the comfort level of communicating in English, the ability to get the work done and cheaper costs.\u201cIndians are known for their hard work, dedication and cheap labour which attract the industry to hire them. Most of the people can speak and communicate well with clients and bosses, which gives them an upper hand compared to other countries,\u201d said Harsimmar Singh, who has worked on Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) biggies like Avengers, Thor: Ragnarok and the award-winning show The Handsmaid\u2019s Tale.Mr. Singh, who works with Take 5 Productions Inc. in Toronto, recalled his experience of working on Man of Steel when he was in India at the time.\u201cIt was meant to be a big deal for us because the Hollywood studio approached us for labour. We used to make only 5 to 10% of what the artistes used to make in the U.S. and with no overtime pay,\u201d the 29-year-old said.Countries like Canada, New Zealand and Singapore have emerged as major hubs for employing VFX artistes as they are equipped with animation and VFX schools that offer advanced education in various streams, explained Mumbai-based Shreeraj Nair, Senior Technical Executive, Frameboxx Animations and Visual Effect. In Canada, The Vancouver Institute of Media Arts and the Vancouver Film School are some of the names that provide Indians an avenue for advanced studies.\u201cThe same goes for New Zealand where there are education centres such as Media Design School, Massey University etc. These centres help them find employment all over the world. Singapore too has its fair share of VFX studios,\u201d Mr. Nair said.Hollywood may have been going in for a diversity push in its content, but many VFX artistes believe that it\u2019s not all about inclusion. Indians manage to get these jobs, which require extensive training, skill, precision and talent, courtesy cheap labour and smart and hard work, they said.Indrajeet Sisodiya, who works as a compositor at Pixomondo\u2019s Toronto branch, said a lot of names from other races and nationalities cropping up in the end credits is just another phenomenon in the industry.\u201cIt has been happening gradually over the years as Indian artistes slowly started getting accepted for overseas VFX study courses leading them overseas work opportunities. Others who are immensely talented in VFX in India get jobs offered directly from overseas studios and that\u2019s another way of entering Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Sisodiya said.He has worked on Hollywood blockbusters such as Fate of the Furious and is currently working on director Roland Emmerich\u2019s Midway.Another reason for more Indian names out there is because many of these artistes aren\u2019t actually overseas but working in India with international VFX studios opening up branches in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru.Thor: The Dark World, for instance, was outsourced to Prana Studios Ltd (Mumbai) and Bengaluru-based Mr. X contributed to 2018 Oscar winner The Shape of Water.\u201cThis gives a lot of talented Indian artists the opportunity to work for big Hollywood banners. And, if they are good enough, they are even given an opportunity by the VFX companies abroad,\u201d said Montreal-based Sumit Panchasara, who works with Moving Pictures Company.According to Mr. Panchasara, whose credits include Dumbo and the upcoming Angelina Jolie-starrer Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, while most of the CG (computer graphics) assets of Academy Award winner Life of Pi were developed in India, Disney\u2019s Tinkerbell series was entirely created here.Pranjal Choudhary, of Toronto\u2019s Mavericks VFX, said the number of VFX shots in movies have gone up. VFX companies in the West have opted to outsource a lot of work to their Indian counterparts as India easily has an advantage in terms of turnovers.\u201cA lot of these big Marvel movies are just not possible to make without employing thousands of Indian VFX artistes. It also allows the artistes in Hollywood to focus more on the creative aspect of the project,\u201d said Mr. Choudhary, who worked on 2014 Best Visual Effects Oscar winner Gravity.Earlier this month, many Indian and Indian-origin names, including Sherry Bharda of Hichki fame and Srinivas Mohan, best known for his work on 2.0 and Baahubali: The Beginning, were invited to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science (AMPAS) to represent the Visual Effects department.Mr. Nair said it is about time Indian artistes in this field got their due.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to know that such talented Indian VFX artistes have been invited to the AMPAS. Indian visual effects artistes are getting their much deserved recognition,\u201d he said. "

      "The story so far: For a little over a decade, the term blockchain has been flitting in and out of news cycles, especially in connection with bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency. The Reserve Bank of India has banned speculation and investment in cryptocurrencies. Of late, however, blockchain is seeing a revival, and companies are looking at how to use the tremendous potential of the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency.It is a foundational technology or a platform that allows designing a secure way to record transactions and circulate it among signatories, or any kind of target group with an Internet connection. At its core it is an extremely democratic ledger that cannot be arbitarily manipulated and easily shareable.Blockchain\u2019s appeal is that it achieves this without a central authority. Blockchain burst into public consciousness because of its association with Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious individual or cabal that laid out a white paper on how blockchain could be applied to bitcoin, a virtual currency wrought from the principles of blockchain. Having money free of the fiat of Central governments raised utopian possibilities especially in a world where democracies complain of being subverted and labour and capital continue to be entangled in the elusive quest for equilibrium. Thereafter, it spawned its own hype-cycle, imitation currencies, association with the sordid and Dark Net. While cryptocurrencies have a bad reputation, Silicon Valley tech giants and investment banks are trying to salvage the underlying promise of blockchain and use it for other collaborations. \n\nAlso read \n\nBitcoin: the birth of an asset\nKeerthik Sasidharan\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0Also read  Bitcoin: the birth of an assetEvery block in a blockchain is a record of transactions and the more of the latter, the longer the chain. Just as worthless paper transforms into valuable currency with the signature of the RBI governor, blocks are great because they provide an unalterable document of the history of every transaction. In the context of currency, it stores the place, time, value (rupee, for example) and location of a purchase. There is minimal identifying information and every block is linked to a unique \u2018digital signature\u2019 of the transacting participants. Every block is distinguished from another through a unique code which is a string of numbers. When you use your debit or credit card to make a transaction, VISA or Mastercard employ their technology to verify your bank account, connect with banks and process a transaction. In blockchain applications, this verifying role is outsourced to several computers on a network \u2014 each has the exact same copy of the block. These computers verify the genuineness of transaction by solving mathematical problems that can only be done in brute-force, energy intensive ways that require a lot of computational power, and therefore electricity. This is a key reason why blockchain enthusiasts vouch for the security of blockchain-backed transactions. Depending on where the blockchain technology is deployed, these participating computers or users have to be incentivised for all that energy expenditure.In the case of bitcoin, the computers are rewarded with bitcoin. This is stored in digital wallets and may be used like money provided there are sellers of real world goods who would accept bitcoins. Nowdays, they are frequently traded as another speculative, volatile asset.As of today nothing, but blockchain backers say it solves the problem of \u2018trust\u2019. Because the major cost of any transaction or exchange of services or goods is the act of verification \u2014 VISA charges fees to ensure that your card swipe is connected to your account or a property charges you for the effort of ensuring that you are entering into a genuine transaction \u2014 blockchain asks you to trust the energy-intensive nature of mathematical problems and have them masquerade them as \u2018locks\u2019 to secure your money, confidential documents or any kind of information. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of blockchain \n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of blockchain While blockchain has the aura of transparency \u2014 anybody supposedly can check the history of a \u2018block\u2019 \u2014 it is at its core impervious to common sense. However, just as the inability to grasp in a visceral sense how letters typed on a mobile phone transform and make their way into another phone instantaneously a continent away does not stop people from using WhatsApp, blockchain technology has created enough hype and drama to have drawn the world\u2019s wealthiest to invest in it and inveigle it into ordinary lives.Facebook this year announced Libra, a kind of blockchain-backed digital currency. According to report in a 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review (HBR), \u201cBank of America, JPMorgan, the New York Stock Exchange, Fidelity Investments, and Standard Chartered are testing blockchain technology as a replacement for paper-based and manual transaction processing in such areas as trade finance, foreign exchange, cross-border settlement, and securities settlement\u201dEthereum is another blockchain-based startup that looks to decentralise online information. Its ambition is beyond overturning online banking and it claims that if it were to work as envisioned, it will give users control over their data unlike the present where a lot of our privacy is ceded to Google and Amazon\u2019s servers. Some plan to apply blockchain to trace the origin of food and where it is grown and yet others to journalism and \u2018fact-checking\u2019 applications. Unlike blockchain\u2019s distributed computing philosophy, all these applications ultimately store information on a coalition of repositories.The HBR article cited earlier, by Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani, likens blockchain to the early days of the Internet, which was made possible by so-called distributed computing. A new mode, called the TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol), which specified how computers could be networked to transmit and receive packets of digital information, turned out to be a platform that laid the base for private networks, email, the web, websites, search engines. TCP/IP minimises central management and makes networks resilient and far-reaching. The protocol was not the crying need of humanity but once in place, upended the telecommunications industry and in the last three decades virtually every aspect of life."

      "\nAn aerial view of the LIGO detector site near Livingston, Louisiana, U.S. that was released by Caltech/MIT/LIGO Laboratory in 2016. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nLIGO Laboratory\n The story so far: On September 14, 2015, the two LIGO detectors in the U.S., at Livingston in Louisiana, and Hanford in Washington, registered a disturbance that was not unlike the chirp of a bird. It was due to gravitational waves travelling outwards from a point 1.3 billion light years away from the earth. At this point, two massive black holes with masses 29 and 36 times that of the sun had merged to give off gravitational wave disturbances. Black holes are exotic objects that we know little about, but their immense gravitational pull which traps even the fastest object in the world, which is light, is legendary. When objects with such an immense gravity merge, the disturbance is felt by the very fabric of space time and travels outward from the merger, not unlike ripples on a pond surface. Thus, gravitational waves have been described as \u201cripples in the fabric of space time\u201d. Following the 2015 detection, which later won the Physics Nobel (2017), the two LIGO detectors detected seven such binary black hole merger events before they were joined by the European Virgo detector in 2017. The two facilities have now detected 10 events. The Japanese detector, KAGRA, or Kamioka Gravitational-wave Detector, is expected to join the international network soon. In the meantime, in a collaboration with LIGO, a gravitational wave detector is being set up in India. The LIGO India project is expected to join the international network in a first science run in 2025.The acronym LIGO stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. LIGO consists of a pair of huge interferometers, each having two arms which are 4 km long. Remarkable precision is needed to detect a signal as faint as a gravitational wave, and the two LIGO detectors work as one unit to ensure this. Naturally, this requires weeding out noise very carefully, for when such a faint signal is being detected, even a slight human presence near the detector could derail the experiment by drowning out the signal.LIGO, unlike usual telescopes, does not \u201csee\u201d the incoming ripples in spacetime. It does not even need to, because gravitational waves are not a part of electromagnetic spectrum or light. They are not light waves but a different phenomenon altogether \u2014 a stretching of spacetime due to immense gravity. A single LIGO detector cannot confidently detect this disturbance on its own. At least two detectors are needed. This is because the signal is so weak that even a random noise could give out a signal that can mislead one into thinking a genuine gravitational wave has been detected. It is because two detectors have detected the faint signal in coincidence that the observer is convinced it is a genuine reading and not noise.Right now, with just three detectors, there is huge uncertainty in determining where in the sky the disturbance came from. Observations from a new detector in a far-off position will help locate the source of the gravitational waves more accurately. Mergers of black holes or neutron stars, rapidly rotating neutron stars, supernova explosions and the remnants of the disturbance caused by the formation of the universe, the Big Bang itself, are the strongest sources. There can be many other sources, but these are likely to be too weak to detect.As a largely unknown and fundamental phenomenon, gravitational waves are interesting to scientists. But once many more detectors are in place, the study also offers a new way to map out the universe, using gravitational-wave astronomy. Perhaps one day we will have such accurate detection facilities that signatures of gravitational waves bouncing off celestial objects can help us detect and map them.LIGO India will come up in Maharashtra, near Aundha in Hingoli district. Most of the land has been acquired, and the small balance is going through a slightly longer acquisition procedure. The project is formally in the construction phase, with the building design conceptualised. Says Tarun Souradeep, spokesperson for LIGO India, \u201cWe are close to finalising the civil infrastructure drawings. The plans for immense vacuum infrastructure have been conceptualized, reviewed and are in an advanced stage.\u201d Like the LIGO detectors, the one at LIGO India will also have two arms of 4 km length. But while there are similarities there will be differences too. Being an ultra-high precision large-scale apparatus, LIGO India is expected to show a unique \u201ctemperament\u201d determined by the local site characteristics. In an email to The Hindu, Dr. Souradeep, says, \u201cLIGO India and its complex feedback control loops to high sensitivity will follow a fairly independent track and poses an exciting full-scale challenge. Under a memorandum of understanding, the National Geophysical Research Institute is carrying out a year-long, multiple-station seismic survey campaign at the LIGO India site to characterise the local properties. This is in addition to the elaborate geotechnical and geophysical survey completed earlier this year.\u201d "

      "The chart-topping Russian-made FaceApp, which allows users to see how they will look as they age, is in the eye of a political storm in the U.S., with one senator urging an FBI investigation into its \u201cnational security and privacy risks\u201d.A celebrity favourite, the app deploys artificial intelligence to modify users\u2019 photos, adding wrinkles or subtracting years from their faces.On Wednesday, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sounded the alarm over FaceApp\u2019s Russian developer, calling for the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission to \u201clook into the national security & privacy risks\u201d connected to the application.\u201cFaceApp\u2019s location in Russia raises questions regarding how and when the company provides access to the data of U.S. citizens to third parties, including potentially foreign governments,\u201d the New York senator said in a letter to the FBI.Currently the most downloaded free app on Google Play with more than 100 million users, FaceApp was launched two years ago and went viral after its latest editing tool, an ageing filter, sparked a flood of celebrity selfies.FaceApp\u2019s Russian backers have not responded to Mr. Schumer\u2019s letter.But its CEO told the Washington Post that Russian authorities did not have any access to any user data.Yaroslav Goncharov also told the newspaper that most photos are deleted from its servers within 48 hours and said the app did not use the pictures for any other purpose.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Noticed how your timeline and social media feed is flooded with photos of people suddenly looking aged? No, you aren\u2019t stuck in a time warp. Posting \u2018old person\u2019 selfies on social media is the latest fun thing to do. Move over all those beauty missions and apps meant to flatter you into thinking slim, young and radiant. Celebs and influencers are posting these \u2018old person\u2019 selfies thanks to the FaceApp, a photo editing app developed by Russian company Wireless Lab.FaceApp is designed to create realistic transformations of faces using various filters and features, the first version of which was released in 2017. The free version offers a limited choice of filters including the one that is going viral right now. The feature that has tweeps going crazy for the app is the \u2018old\u2019 option where the app gives you three versions of your face \u2014 two young and one that looks really old and probable.This app is no different from Snapchat with the baby-face and gender-swap filters and now Instagram\u2019s many additional filters. The app is popular, obviously, because of the final outcome. Using a picture of any person, the filter throws back an image of them looking considerably older. Cautions while using an appReports from Forbes and Wired have been circulating about Wireless Lab\u2019s intentions. Much like the scary Cambridge Analytica scandal (in which a Facebook quiz acquired the personal data of millions of people), FaceApp now has the facial data of over 150 million people, according to install-analytics. So to keep your data as safe as possible, here are some pointers worth following:When downloading any new app , users get permission-dialogue boxes, requesting for access to media and document libraries, your camera and microphone. Read carefully and take a stance on what permissions you may or may not be granting. Some apps end up linking up with apps which are in turn linked with banking apps, so be mindful. One shouldn\u2019t use social media accounts to link-up with any third-party apps. For example, if you use Facebook to log into an app such as FaceApp, they may be able to gain access to device details, or even behaviour patterns. Any data you voluntarily or involuntarily supply can then be used by the app (maliciously or otherwise) or sold as data.FaceApp also shows users what their alternative genders or even races would look like. The app might have taken the Internet by storm only recently, but it has actually been around for a while and enjoying a brief resurgence on the back of its latest Artificial Intelligence neural network software. Considering the photos one is seeing on social media, the accuracy is quite frightening. Some users, who\u2019ve used FaceApp, are now scared of ageing at all! After all, that is the closest one can get to peeking into their future. \u2018Old\u2019 versions of Bollywood actors Varun Dhawan and Arjun Kapoor have garnered thousands of likes on Instagram, while Malayalam actor Hareesh Kanaran used his FaceApp post to pay a compliment to fellow actor Mammootty. Hollywood has also participated actively, with Shazam! actor Zachary Levi jumping on board, joking he\u2019ll look like Tom Hanks. And, of course, is it even 2019 if we leave out the never-aging Keanu Reeves? Tom Marks tweeted a regular photo of Keanu Reeves and captioned it, \u201cThanks, FaceApp for showing us what Keanu will look like at 90.\u201d If all this seems too pretty perfect, check the memes which the meme makers are working on. The best has to be the meme that shows Anil Kapoor\u2019s \u2018aged\u2019 photo and says, \u201cYou really thought a filter could age him?\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nISRO\u2019s GSLV carrying Chandrayaan-2 stands at Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota after the mission was aborted at the last minute on July 15.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: AP There is no clarity yet on when Chandrayaan-2 may be launched, three days after the launch of the moon mission was halted on the launchpad less than an hour before lift-off.Fresh alerts to aircraft pilots and officials speaking on condition of anonymity indicate a broad period between July 20-31. But a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said it was part of a wide window indicated earlier and cautioned against assuming any finality. \u201cA date will be known only when those working on the job get some clarity,\u201d he said.ISRO is yet to publicly share any details on the hitch that was noticed just an hour before the scheduled launch at 2.51 a.m. on July 15. Asked if the glitch related to the GSLV-MkIII launch vehicle, ISRO\u2019s spokesman declined to comment, citing the \u2018classified\u2019 nature of expert committee findings.A NOTAM (notice to airmen) is routinely issued ahead of all rocket and missile launches to notify aircraft pilots [and ships] to enable them to avoid using that route during the specified period.A third NOTAM for the GSLV-MkIII/M1 indicated an imminent launch during July 20-31 between 2 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. IST. But ISRO\u2019s spokesman said he would not endorse the information to avoid \u2018causing any confusion\u2019.Chandrayaan-2 is to be India\u2019s first lander-rover mission to the Moon as a sequel to the first orbiting mission of 2008. India also hopes to be the first country to land at the lunar south pole.The landing has been planned for September 6, or the next day, almost a month after the spacecraft nears the Moon and starts orbiting it.The spacecraft is designed to go around Earth for 17 days in increasingly bigger loops. In the process it makes use of Earth\u2019s gravity to build up power and saves some fuel.With the delay in the launch, ISRO may shrink the original 17-day period that the spacecraft was set to go around the Earth in increasingly higher orbits before being put on course to the Moon. A senior scientist said going by the experience of Chandrayaan-1 and the Mars Orbiter Mission of 2013, there was enough cushion in the mission to reduce the number of Earth orbits. - and later even around moon (28 days). A reduced number of earth orbits could make up for the lost days.However, the day it must leave earth and the day it must enter moon's orbit cannot be touched, so as to keep the landing position and schedule intact, the scientist emphasised.(Launch vehicles and orbiting satellites are built to be as fuel efficient as possible for good performance.)As to why glitches show up so late in the mission, the same scientist said all systems pass tests done individually, on ground, and it is difficult to predict if they may behave differently in an integrated state.This is also the first operational or working flight for the GSLV-MkIII rocket, which has flown well only twice before. With more flights behind it, there would have been more information on its pattern, said another scientist.An uprated and human certified MkIII will be used to take astronauts to space around 2022, but after two crewed flights.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nElon Musk. File photo. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP  Futurist entrepreneur Elon Musk late on Tuesday revealed his secretive Neuralink startup is making progress on an interface linking brains with computers, and said they hope to begin testing on people next year.Mr. Musk has long contended that a neural lace meshing minds with machines is vital if people are going to avoid being so outpaced by Artificial Intelligence that, under the best of circumstances, humans would be akin to \u201chouse cats.\u201dMr. Musk and members of the Neuralink team laid out progress they have made on their mission at an event held in San Francisco to recruit talent in software, robotics, neuroscience and more.\u201cUltimately, we can do a full brain-machine interface,\u201d Musk said.\u201cAchieve a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence.\u201dNeuralink unveiled an early version of a tiny sensor with hair-thin strands that could be implanted in a brain through a small incision by a robot built for the high-precision task.\u201cThey are tiny electrodes and the robot is delicately implanting them,\u201d Mr. Musk said, noting there could be thousands of the electrodes connected to a brain.\u201cThis is something that is not going to be stressful to put in; will work well, and it is wireless.\u201dThe chip will communicate wirelessly with an earpiece, which relays information to a smartphone application, according to Neuralink.For now, the goal is to let a person with the implants control a smartphone with thought, but the technology could eventually extend to other devices such as robotic arms. \u201cThis has tremendous potential,\u201d Musk said.\u201cWe hope to have this in a human patient before the end of next year.\u201dAn early focus of the team is using the technology to address brain diseases and paralysis, but the longer aim is to make implants so safe, reliable and easy that they could be elective surgery options for people seeking to enhance their brains with computing power, according to a neurosurgeon on the Neuralink team.Mr. Musk said the goal was to make it as easy a procedure as laser eye surgery.\u201cI've said a lot about AI over the years; I think that even in a benign scenario, we will be left behind,\u201d he said.\u201cWith a high bandwidth brain-machine interface we can actually go for the ride and have the option of merging with AI.

      "\nThe Redmi K20 series devices \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n When China-based Redmi became a sub-brand, ultimately separating from parent company Xiaomi, on January 10 this year, many expected upgraded smartphone experiences at a bang for their buck. That said, today the brand is launching their first-ever flagship devices: the K20 series.Introducing the new Aura Prime design language, the Redmi K20 phones come with an AI triple camera setup, comprising of a 48MP main camera, 8MP (megapixel) telephoto and a 13MP wide-angle. Plus the phones come in three colour variants: glacier blue, flame red and carbon black.The K20 family is also powered by a huge 4,000 mAh battery with fast charging, which can last upto two days in regular usage conditions. Both the phones come with USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack and fast-charge support. Redmi K20 series, each device weighing 191gm, comes with the highest quality standards; P2i nano-coating makes the phones splash-proof, while Gorilla\u00ae Glass 5 on the front and rear of both phones make them durable and long-lasting. K20 series common specifications16.2cm (6.39) AMOLED Horizon Display19.5:9 aspect ratio, 91.9% screen:body ratioFHD+ display (2340 x 1080)Pulsating notification LED on pop-up camera (edge-lit module)Dual SIM Dual VoLTE with Carrier AggregationOther intuitive quality improvements include fall detection, which makes the pop-up camera retract automatically in case of a drop. Security features for the series include a 7th gen in-display fingerprint sensor as well as an AI face unlock.The K20 Pro, being the jacked-up version of the two, features 48MP Sony IMX586 with Laser Autofocus and an Octa-core 2.84GHz Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon\u2122 855 chipset while the K20 is still strong with the Octa-core 2.2GHz Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon\u2122 730. Of course, the storage capacities vary: while the K20 comes in 6GB/64GB and 6GB/128GB options, the K20 Pro offers models of 6GB/128GB and 8GB/256GB capacities.Manu Jain, managing director of Xiaomi India, and vice president of Xiaomi, said, \u201cAs the first of our Redmi flagship series in India, Redmi K20 and K20 Pro truly redefine the ultimate flagship experience. While the premium 20K+ segment was relatively small traditionally, we are beginning to see massive growth in this segment. We hope Redmi K20 Pro and Redmi K20 will completely disrupt this segment with the kind of experience on offer.\u201dRedmi K20 Pro is being launched at \u20b927,999 for the 6GB+128GB variant and INR 30,999 for the 8GB+256GB variant.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/have-you-participated-in-sareetwitter/article28475609.ece",
      "\nA tweet\n\u00a0 For the past two days, #SareeTwitter on Twitter has been trending way past the six yards many expected. By Tuesday afternoon, pictures of people in their favourite saris were all over the microblogging site.Actor and director Rahul Ravindran also shared pictures of his wife Chinamayee donning sari, captioning \u201c#SareeTwitter anta kada\u2026\u201d with plenty of pride.Most interestingly, the pictures which garnered the most likes and retweets were of the hand-me-down saris. Twitter user Visha Suchde posted a picture of herself in a bright yellow sari, captioning the image, \u201cThe best I can offer #SareeTwitter is a picture from when I wore my mommy\u2019s wedding saree. A stunning Parsi cutwork that I hold closest to my heart. No one makes these anymore.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nA tweet by Rahul Ravindran\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial memories take the trophy in this hashtag whether they\u2019re personal or ones which remind us of handloom heritage. And most of the people who are in this hashtag are young, mostly people who are digitally omnipresent.For Nikaytaa Malhotra, founder of sari-draping community The Indian Draping Company, the #SareeTwitter trend is something special. She comments, \u201cHigh time this is trending! Conversations in certain groups like \u2018Saree Story\u2019, people talk so much about the sari meaning. Unfortunately we don\u2019t wear the sari enough, even though they\u2019re associated with special memories like wedding occasions or first days of work.\u201d Nikaytaa appreciates the exchange of ideas and stories as well.Could there have been more diversity in people participating? We haven\u2019t seen much from another South Asian community though, such as Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. \u201cWe also have so many Indians living abroad but I haven\u2019t seen people posting the sari pics. I\u2019ll be waiting! I\u2019d also love to see the different types of drape-styles, including the nivi drapes of which I\u2019ve seen just three posts,\u201d adds Nikaytaa. Nikaytaa encourages people, both men and women, to ignore the trolling on the platform as well. So don\u2019t let the insecurity get to you!Sadly like any online trend, the shelf-life will peak for 40 hours max. Nikaytaa points out there are plenty of safe and permanent groups and meetups (like sari swaps or draping workshops) to keep the conversation of a sari alive. \u201cResources and open spaces along with knowledge-exchange avenues are so important for this,\u201d concludes Nikaytaa.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAre we too dependent on wearable devices? \n",
      "Updated: July 16, 2019 14:21 IST\rPublished: July 16, 2019 14:08 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/are-we-too-dependent-on-wearable-devices/article28472430.ece",
      "The likes of Black Mirror, Love, Death & Robots and even Archer have taught us to be wary of the dependency we may end up experiencing with the advent of wearable technology, nicknamed wearables. So much of the pull of wearables is geared towards trend up-keep \u2014 which some may dub \u2018sheepism.\u2019 So here we are to bust some myths through some long-term experience with our own wearable to which we may have raised a brow.Fitbit Charge 3 and Cardiogram\u2018Listen to your heart\u2019, famously sang Roxette in 1988. That\u2019s advice I\u2019ve taken seriously... which is why when Cardiogram (a smartphone app which functions as a digital health and fitness diary and also helps detect heart conditions) recently partnered with Fitbit, the app was promptly added to my list of downloads. Cardiogram makes use of heart rate and sleep rate data from wearable devices to monitor the wearer\u2019s conditions and understand their symptoms.The Fitbit Charge 3 I\u2019ve been using \u2014 primarily to calculate calories burnt \u2014 now also functions as my personal cardiologist. While these wearables are equipped with heart rate and sleep trackers, coupled with this app, it is said to detect signs of conditions like diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation using heart rate data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned also probably explains why the device is on my wrist for longer durations than before. But given its good looks, I am not complaining. With a sporty white strap that has a perforated design, this version is much more glamorous than its earlier siblings. That said, it\u2019s not restricted to the boot camp or badminton court alone. The watch is versatile and, much to my delight, fits in just as well in a formal brunch setting or a cocktail party. And what a conversation starter this gadget is: people almost always ask \u2018what you are wearing?\u2019, even if they are sporting the most elegant Breitling themselves. The bands of Charge 3 come in different colours: Standard (black or blue grey), Horween leather (plum and midnight blue), Woven bands (charcoal and periwinkle) and Special edition (white band with a graphite case or purple band with a rose gold case). The latter even comes with an additional black band in case you need options.On the whole, the design is sleek. It is light and sits snug on the wrist. The font is easy to read and doesn\u2019t have you squinting and feeling years older. It lets you receive messages, phone calls and emails if you choose. In terms of syncing with my phone, it\u2019s a lot more hassle-free than the Fitbit Alta. There\u2019s an all-day real-time sync option that keeps the activities of the watch updated on the app on the phone. My only qualm is the sleep tracker that shows a few abnormalities in terms of hours slept and deep and light sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battery life is commendable and lasts for up to a week after it\u2019s fully charged. So if you\u2019re travelling for a few days, you don\u2019t have the hassle of carrying the charger along. The watch, like most fitness tracking devices, is like a persistent sibling. It vibrates and nudges when you\u2019ve been sitting on your bottom for too long. It also encourages you with badges when you\u2019ve outdone yourself in terms of steps taken. It is for this token of appreciation that on many days \u2014 when I could have just bullied the youngest in the department to collect my Swiggy order from the gate \u2014 I\u2019ve found myself bounding to the gate under the scorching sun to collect my delivery.The Charge 3 is water-proof. A big plus point because I\u2019ve often wondered how many calories I burn when I swim. I finally have an answer. And that also means I need to throw in a few more laps and cut down on socialising during pool time. It also lets you choose from exercise modes such as run, yoga, bike... \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at the end of it all, when you need to slow down and catch your breath, this device lets you do that with its Relax mode and breathing guidance. 3 .2. 1...Okay, time to close my eyes and breatheLivia In the world of wearables, the design is a huge aspect which we cannot place low on our priorities. After all, nowadays, the customisable factor is everything and tech brands market wearables as an extension of the self.The Livia, a menstrual pain-cancelling device, is customisable as far as the skin colour goes. Perhaps the electrode pads which one sticks to their lower abdomen could be the same or even similar colour as the user\u2019s skin... for those less keen on being super vocal about sporting this device. I had to shove my shirt over it.Just like when you switch between Apple or Android, there is considerable acclimatisation in navigating the device. But with the Livia, there\u2019s no screen so you don\u2019t need to worry.There are some days during my cycle when I find myself panicking at the smallest fraction of a cramp, quickly reaching for the device.Like most wearables, the Livia has a battery life users have to be well aware of. Because I was becoming so reliant on the Livia as part of my monthly routine, my charging station at home changed too. I set up a wide adapter with different outlets, including one for my Livia. But what did this tell me? I wasn\u2019t shy about it, even at work where I\u2019d hook it up to my CPU. When colleagues would ask what the adorable-looking device was, I\u2019d be pretty honest about it.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRepresentational image of people enjoying mobile entertainment\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nVSanandhakrishna for Getty images/iStock\n We\u2019ve seen the world of crypto shake hands with the gaming industry in different ways this year; it seemed as though the world of geek couldn\u2019t get enough of it! In fact, earlier this year, Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine\u2019s game developers (of Fortnite fame) bumped fists with blockchain-fuelled games platform The Abyss.Other entertainment ecosystems have blockchain in their DNA, too. One ocurity, share founder Nitin Narkhede and co-founder Deepak Jayaram.After a presentation of the platform along with a beta version at Cannes Film Festival in May, the mobile launch was just last month in June. The platform offers more than 200 films (a number which keeps growing). With the number of world cinema film festivals in our cities, it is appropriate that a platform be solely dedicated to international talent which have been featured at Cannes, Tribeca, Sundance and Berlinale \u2014 as done with myNK. Deepak adds that most of the content has never before been released into India. Additionally, MinersINC has partnered with leaders in film distribution to bring this content to our devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-founder Deepak Jayaram and founder Nitin Narkhede\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s all you need to know about myNK and its inner-workings:Nitin started thinking of myNK in mid-2017, having incorporated MinersINC in October of that year. \u201cWe spent almost a year prototyping the model, and we saw a number of issues with the blockchain technology because it doesn\u2019t have the ability to carry the massive size of these films (in raw form, they\u2019re about 150GB) and we had to them accessible to consumers at just 3GB. But we figured out how to mitigate such challenges. In the last seven to eight months, we really pulled the packages together. The research doesn\u2019t stop, in terms of security and performance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmmaker and recently-joined member of The Academy Anurag Kashyap is one of the first mentors for myNK. When Nitin got a buy-in from an investor, their condition was for an industry buy-in, given the whole process was, in essence, disruptive to the existing foundations. The investor wanted to know if the industry would accept this or not. That\u2019s when Anurag hopped on board; when Nitin explained the process of leveraging the technology for the good of the film, the filmmaker was immediately enraptured, expressing his long-time wish to bring global cinema to Indian audiences.Anurag Kashyap\u2019s picksFish Tank: 15-year-old Mia lives with her mother and sister in the housing projects of Essex. Andrea Arnold\u2019s film won the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.Mea Maxima Culpa: Alex Gibney exposes the abuse of power in the catholic Church and a cover-up that runs from Wisconsin to Ireland all the way up to the Vatican.The Student:A high school student in the midst of a crisis becomes convinced that the world has been lost to evil, and begins to challenge the morals and beliefs of those around him. Kirill Serebrennikov\u2019s film won the Francois Chalais Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.Burma VJ: Oscar-nominated Burma VJ documents the 2007 uprising of Burma through the camera of its independent journalists.Departures: Academy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film, Yojiro Takita\u2019s Departures deals with Daigo, a cellist, whose dream is shattered when his Tokyo orchestra suddenly closes down.Nitin observes Anurag as \u201ca designer of what myNK is today\u201d. Specifically, Anurag provided a lot of insight on how to showcase the technology to film distributors. For something as complicated as blockchain, the front-end and user experience we see are fairly simple. The orange and peach hues of myNK app aren\u2019t harsh, nor are you bombarded by advertising, emphasising the strength of the P2P concept. Transparency is the name of the game here. Given MinersINC is Peer-2-Peer, there\u2019s no intermediary, and standard film distribution models have multiple entities down the line, explains Nitin, adding, \u201cIn some cases, content sits with intermediaries and filmmakers have no visibility or clarity as to what happens on the other end. myNK is solving this problem by providing visibility and transparency of the content. As an independent filmmaker, if you want to release your film and see how the consumer is interacting with your artwork, this secure zero-cost distribution model, as we call it, is a solution. The filmmaker can use the data to reposition his film or to help shape future productions.\u201dDeepak adds that he jumped in last August. His role is largely in reaching out to global entities. \u201cWithin the blockchain community, there are people who work with the promise of what could be. We approached people with a solid use-case in a market with many issues from a global standpoint. What we presented was how their concerns would be addressed, which led us to being among five blockchain companies presenting our models at at Berlinale, ultimately leading us to Cannes.\u201d The duo shares they were indeed met with incredible optimism and interest at Cannes, which has led to more link-ups and development.According to Nitin, blockchain technology has a remarkable ability to implement \u2018smart contract\u2019 systems to streamline transactions, provide better clarity between the consumer and the content provider and the platform supervisors, and also to overall improve processes. The cryptography serves as a layer of assurance for the filmmaker that his work is secured, cannot be copied and/or pirated. Tacking on the concept of transparency, the filmmaker is once again privy to every transaction his film is making. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the blockchain space since 2015,\u201d says Nitin, \u201cso the perception of blockchain back then was so different. But the questions that arose were around the potential benefits to the community with respect to micro-payments and micro-distributions, especially.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral screengrabs of myNK mobile \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clearly a data-oriented model, with not just filmmakers understanding which of their content is being viewed but also how many times and even which parts are being rewinded and fast-forwarded. While most film industries wait for financial quarters for their cheques, myNK eliminates that, too.For the user, the model is saddled with a rewards incentive to retain engaged loyal customers.MinersINC have taken every safety threat into consideration when structuring myNK. \u201cThe technology thrives on security and transparency,\u201d comments Nitin. \u201cThe security is in-built, protected by cryptography and the highest standards of security available today. The data is encrypted and you require a private key to decrypt it. For example, Udta Punjab (2016) was leaked from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). We could see it was a CBFC copy. That said, by adopting a blockchain-based platform, which is myNK, I can give CBFC the ability to watch that film with certain login credentials; one cannot pirate or copy that version. This is an ever-evolving realm and practice, and new methods will come up, though. We reduced the possibility of piracy and leaking.\u201dThe second factor of the P2P model; myNK doesn\u2019t consider itself as an intermediary but as a protected platform, thus implying that a great deal of effort to break the blockchain protocol protecting each film would be needed. myNK is actually structured in such a way that malicious entities would be demotivated towards leaking or pirating content.

      "\n\nIn and out of the Upside Down... with Stranger Things 3: The Game\n\n",

      "\nA demogorgon in rage, from a screengrab of the game \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n The latest season of one of the hottest shows on Netflix, Stranger Things, is now ready for your binge-watching pleasure. To add to the otherwordly fun, the nice folks at the streaming service-slash-production house have given you an option to further the experience as a video game. As a rule of thumb, games based on movies or TV shows usually suck, and the same is true vice versa. So let us answer this big question for you... does Stranger Things 3: The Game fall prey to the same curse or does it just have enough to capture your heart the same way the show does?Stranger Things 3: The GameDeveloper & Publisher: BonusXP, NetflixPrice: \u20b91399 ($19.99) for Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox OneStranger Things is a unique show capturing the \u2018kid detective\u2019 formula featured in movies like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial or The Goonies and combines them with Stephen King-esque horror. The result is a delightful nostalgic adventure into a fantastic world. Now, if you have not seen a single episode of Stranger Things, then stop reading this right now and play a little catch-up. While this review is relatively spoiler-free, it will reference a few elements from the show.With the disclaimer out of the way, Stranger Things season 3 sees our wonderful cast of heroes face-off against the resurgence of a new evil. Plus, there\u2019s a new faction of bad guys which has taken an interest in the recently-closed portal into The Upside Down, a vile mirror universe from which an evil creature known as the Mind Flayer has emerged. All of the action seems to be centred around a brand new mall for which the townspeople of Hawkins have gone ga-ga.\n\n\n\n\n\nA streetview in a screengrab of the game \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n So it\u2019s up to you and a cast of 12 characters to get to the bottom of this.The best way to describe Stranger Things 3: The Game is a combination of the isometric The Legend of Zelda series, the beat-em-up of a Streets of Rage game and the style of a Japanese role-playing game (JRPG). It reminded me of the 90s hit Game Boy version of Jurassic Park and the South Park games. The game is steeped in nostalgia and is inspired by the Super Nintendo era, ultimately creating an action arcade role-playing game that\u2019s very Diablo-esque, with pixel graphics versions of all your favourite characters from the show in fully isometric locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nA screengrab of the game; the kids of Hawkins in the dark \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nThe game has you playing the teen ensemble and the concerned adults who seem to lose all of their charisma in their 16-bit avatar; each of these characters have their own fighting style to beat up burly bad guys . In the middle of all that action you get to speak to townspeople going about their day as you roam around solving various quests, which seem to follow the third season to the tee.The action is repetitive, with just a normal attack and special move at your disposal. However, you can switch between characters in your party of two at will. If you have a friend, things get interesting, as they can play as the second character.The worst part of the game is the failure to completely capture the aesthetic of the show and its 80s vibe, with its iconic neon or brooding dark palettes. If the game was aiming for authentic 80s graphics, then it has missed its mark completely, as the SNES came out about a decade later.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that you, Billy? A screengrab from the game \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nIf it was aiming for the charm of the show, it does not seem to capture that too.If you must have more Stranger Things 3, then you can replay the show in another format. Yet, this game feels like a big missed opportunity, both from a visual standpoint and one to serve as an expanded lore to the third season.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAsus 6Z is a head-turner \n",
      "Updated: July 15, 2019 17:34 IST\rPublished: July 15, 2019 16:28 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-asus-6z-is-a-head-turner/article28436605.ece",
      "If a smartphone company can stay in business after selling phones with a dozen pre-loaded apps then they must be doing something awfully right. Hardware was never an issue with Asus; Google did trust them with the Nexus 7 tablet in 2012. So why haven\u2019t they made at least one memorable flagship phone. Can you name one? Asus 6Z changes that, for sure. The unique motorised camera design, along with flagship specifications, makes the 6Z hard to forget. SpecificationsProcessors 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Mobile Platform, 64-bit Octa-core CPU, Qualcomm Adreno 640 GPUCamera Sony IMX586 48MP image sensor (main); 13MP (ultrawide); Automated panoramas; Laser autofocus sensor, 4K UHD (3840x2160) video at 30/60 fps with EIS on the main camera sensor, slow motion, motion trackingStorage UFS2.1 64GB/128GB/256GB; microSD, up to 2TB (dedicated slot)RAM LPDDR4X 6GB/8GBScreen 6.4 inches; Corning Gorilla Glass 6, 92% screen-to-body ratio, 600nits outdoor readable brightnessOS Android 9.0 (Pie), guaranteed update to Android Q and Android R, ZenUI 6 (Basically, Stock Android)Cost \u20b931,999 (64GB), \u20b934,999 (128GB) and \u20b939,999 (256 GB, only model with 8GB RAM)The phone has a candy bar form factor fitting well in one hand. Unfortunately, I just couldn\u2019t reach the corners with my thumb. So for those of you who prefer one-hand usage, Google\u2019s Pixel 3a is the better bet.The three buttons on the phone are on the right side. The top-most key is the smart key, in addition to traditional buttons. As a default setting, smart key brings up the assistant in a single click; however, it can be customised as per Asus. Hopefully, Asus will make it truly customisable with an update. The concept is great; unfortunately, the design fails, as it\u2019s just impossible to reach it.Another area in which Asus did an oopsie is the rear fingerprint scanner. It\u2019s tiny. One would imagine without snappy face unlock Asus would have got this right for sure. The ideal size for the scanner is on the back cover. Naturally, I dived into the camera immediately after I powered up the 6Z. The rear camera flips up and doubles up as a front camera. The result is that not only does Asus nail its first notchless phone in style, but it could take the crown for the best selfie phone yet. To sum it up, video or photos, front camera or rear, the 6Z will deliver. It has tons of cool features such as automatic panoramic shots, wide angle pictures, 2160p video recording at 60fps with electronic stabilisation and a night-mode which actually makes a difference. Asus really expects you to use the camera, so much so it has a dedicated storage slot expandable to 2TB.Just like 2019 flagships, this one rocks the latest Snapdragon processors. But unlike them, it has a 5000 mAh battery which easily lasts more than a day. But 6Z is best charged overnight, as full-charge takes almost two hours and 30 minutes. As expected, the 6Z handles everything without hiccups. Unfortunately, Asus decided to go ahead with the IPS LCD. This will significantly push the customers with gaming as priority towards the OnePlus 7.\n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, playing PUBG Mobile on the Asus flagship is great. Comparing with Honor 8 Pro, both the game and my performance was better. By the way, I played PUBG without earphones and everything was audible. Despite having one of the loudest speakers on a smartphone, Asus have included an outdoor mode. Talking of audio quality, Asus has an inbuilt equaliser, which can be accessed when connected with earphones, from notifications by tapping on AudioWizard. And yes, 6Z has room for a 3.5 mm jack.The stock Android experience on 6Z is fantastic. Plus, there is dark theme, not a system-wide theme, but it swaps the whites with blacks in the Notification Panel and Settings.If your response to this phone is \u2018Who takes selfies?\u2019, then this phone probably isn\u2019t for you. But if you are a vlogger or someone who uses both front and back camera, then 6Z will up your production considerably.  A bit of advice: get it insured because chances are just a single fall could kill the camera.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Then connect your phone to the Internet for it to start working. There is no need to charge it.\u201dThe monitor checks heartbeat, respiration, sleep cycle, and stress levels and gives daily reports, which will be stored on a cloud. \u201cIt can be accessed by anyone whose phone is connected to Dozee. So, a son or daughter can keep track of their parents\u2019 health, even if they are not living together. There will be an alert for fluctuations in the readings. We have a database of doctors for online consultations.\u201d The device was tested at NIMHANS and Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru. \u201cDozee is 98.4% accurate,\u201d says Mudit.\n\n\n\n\n\n(from Left) Gaurav Parchani,Mudit Dandwate, and Pritish Gupta\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nAn alumni of IIT Bombay, Mudit was working in an automobile company in Germany, when he came up with this idea. \u201cI was away from home and my parents\u2019 health was always at the back of my mind.\u201d On his 24th birthday, he felt the need to do something more. \u201cI resigned and came to India to manufacture a health monitor.\u201d He roped in Gaurav Parchani (co-founder) and Pritish Gupta (COO).The idea of keeping the monitor contact-free was accidental. \u201cWe had left our second prototype under the mattress so that the dog wouldn\u2019t chew on it. Later, we saw the dog lying on the bed and the app showed his heart and breathing rate. We worked from there and launched our product six months ago.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent feature on Dozee is the mindfulness segment that gives personalised suggestions on meditation, based on the heath parameter readings. Dr Deepak Padmanabhan, a consultant electrophysiologist based in Bengaluru who has used Dozee, says, \u201cAs a device that combines the aspect of wellness and medical care, I see a lot of potential in it. It will be of great help, especially for people who are in the critical care unit or spend a lot of time in bed. Also for people who have a history of heart ailments to keep a continuous check.\u201dGoing forward, Mudit says, \u201cWe have now tied up with 15 Indian hospitals, old-age homes and nursing homes, and plan to launch the product in West Asia and the US by October.\u201dAvailable at dozee.io or www.amazon.in for \u20b97199.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Ransomware has been a thorny cybersecurity issue for several years globally, marked by global ransomware attacks known as \u201cWannaCry\u201d and \u201cNotPetya.\u201d While the FBI and others warn against paying ransoms, some analysts say there is no clear answer for victims when critical data is locked. \u201cYou have to do what\u2019s right for your organisation,\u201d Mr. Falco said. Josh Zelonis at Forrester Research offered a similar view, saying in a blog post that victims need to consider paying the ransom as a valid option, alongside other recovery efforts.But Randy Marchany, chief information security officer for Virginia Tech University, said the best answer is to take a hardline \u201cdon\u2019t pay\u201d attitude.Victims often fail to take preventive measures such as software updates and data backups that would limit the impact of ransomware.Brett Callow of Emsisoft says coordinated efforts can help identify some malware and sometimes unlock data.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nU.S. sets $5 bn fine for Facebook \n",

      "\nOnline safety: Some critics of Facebook have argued that the company should face tougher sanctions.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n U.S. regulators have approved a $5 billion penalty to be levied on Facebook to settle a probe into the social network\u2019s privacy and data protection lapses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.The newspaper said the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved the settlement in a 3-2 vote.According to the report, the deal, which would be the largest penalty ever imposed by the FTC for privacy violations, still needs approval from the Justice Department before it is finalised.Although details have not yet been released, the deal will likely include restrictions on how Facebook is able to use personal data.Charlotte Slaiman of the consumer group Public Knowledge thinks it is unlikely the restrictions will be overly harsh.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know key aspects of the settlement: whether Facebook must make any changes to its business model or practices as a result,\u201d said Charlotte Slaiman, the group\u2019s Competition Policy Counsel. \u201cBy itself, this fine will not be sufficient to change Facebook\u2019s behaviour.\u201dThe outlook was more optimistic at the Center for Democracy and Technology, whose president Nuala O\u2019Connor said the fine underscored the importance of \u201cdata stewardship\u201d in the digital age.\u201cThe FTC has put all companies on notice that they must safeguard personal information,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor said.  The FTC announced last year it reopened its investigation into a 2011 privacy settlement with Facebook after revelations that personal data on tens of millions of users was hijacked by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was working on the Donald Trump campaign in 2016.Facebook has also faced questions about whether it improperly shared user data with business partners in violation of the earlier settlement. The leading social network with more than two billion users worldwide has also been facing inquiries on privacy from regulators around the world.  The fine is unlikely to hurt Facebook, which logged a profit of $2.4 billion on revenue that climbed 26% to $15.1 billion in the first three months of this year.Some Facebook critics have argued the company should face tougher sanctions including monitoring of its data practices.Faced with criticism, Facebook\u2019s head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, called on governments to do more to regulate social networks, instead of leaving the work to companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not for private companies, however big or small, to come up with those rules. It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,\u201d Mr. Clegg had said in an interview with the BBC.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWhy is India setting up a mobile phone handsets database?\n\n",
      "Updated: July 14, 2019 12:45 IST\rPublished: July 13, 2019 19:13 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-the-centre-is-setting-up-a-mobile-phone-handsets-database/article28422344.ece",
      "The story so far: The National Telecom Policy of 2012 calls for the establishment of a National Mobile Property Registry to address the issue of \u201csecurity, theft, and other concerns including reprogramming of mobile handsets\u201d. Based on this, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) under the Ministry of Communications initiated a Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) for mobile service providers. The DoT issued a memorandum in July 2017 announcing the CEIR with a pilot project led by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited in Maharashtra. In January 2018, this project was handed over to the Centre for Development of Telematics (CDoT). Now, it is all set to roll out.Based on a 2008 order from the DoT, every mobile network provider in India has an Equipment Identity Register (EIR), or a a database of the phones connected to its network. These EIRs will now share information with a single central database, the CEIR. In essence, it will be a repository of information on all mobile phones connected to networks across India. There were over 1,026 million active wireless phone connections by the end of 2018, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.As per the DoT\u2019s 2017 memorandum, the CEIR will have information on the device\u2019s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number (every phone or mobile broadband device has this unique 15 digit code that precisely identifies the device), model, version, and \u201cother information\u201d. It will also know if the phone is blacklisted, and the reason why it has been blacklisted.Phones are identified based on the IMEI number, which you can find under the battery in many mobiles or by dialling \u2018*#06#\u2019 on the device. Mobile phone manufacturers assign IMEI numbers to each device based on ranges allotted to them by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association. Dual SIM phones will have two IMEI numbers.Such centralised databases are meant to identify and block stolen or illegal mobile phones across networks. Currently, when a customer reports a mobile phone as missing or stolen, mobile service providers have the ability to blacklist the phone\u2019s IMEI in their EIRs and block it from accessing their network. But if the SIM is changed to a new network, it can continue to be in use. With a CEIR, all network operators will be aware that the phone is blacklisted.The CEIR will also access the GSMA\u2019s database of IMEI numbers to check whether the phone is authentic. There are cases of phones being in use with duplicate IMEI numbers, or with all zeroes instead of an authentic IMEI number.Most importantly, as per the DoT\u2019s 2017 memorandum, the CEIR will be able to block services to subscribers. This ability had rested with individual networks till now. The memorandum also mentions enabling \u201cIMEI-based lawful interception\u201d, which means allowing legal authorities to use CEIR data.In its 2010 consultation paper on \u201cissues relating to blocking of IMEI for lost/stolen mobile handsets,\u201d the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) raises a key issue with the CEIR \u2014 who should maintain such a high-value database? Should it be the service provider, or a neutral third party?In their responses to the consultation paper, many major service providers preferred having a third party, ranging from international bodies to TRAI itself as suggested by the BSNL. The CDoT, which is reportedly readying to roll out the service, is an autonomous entity under the DoT."

      "The world of ASMR \u2014 autonomous sensory meridian response \u2014 is constantly innovating. Last month, Twitter user @altdoly used clips of major fights on American reality TV shows like Keeping up with the Kardashians and The Real Housewives to create viral content. The Jonas Brothers got on the bandwagon with a whispered version of their hit single, \u2018Sucker\u2019. The three-minute-long video is equal parts soothing thanks to Nick\u2019s voice, and hilarious thanks to Joe\u2019s antics and Kevin forgetting the lyrics.Even as myriad kinetic sand cutting and food chewing videos flood the results on a quick Instagram search for #ASMR, a growing number of digital artists\u2019 work is (sometimes unwittingly) finding an audience in the space.Here are some Instagram accounts to follow, to make your brain tingle with technology.Nikunj Patel, founder of this Mumbai-based visual and motion design studio, moonlights as a producer of electronic music under the moniker moebius. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in numerous projects which are at the intersection of design and music with a touch of live performance added in,\u201d says the NID graduate, who has worked with Magnetic Fields Festival, Saavn, NH7 Weekender and Puma. His work is inspired by music, in that it follows patterns and rhythms that often repeat and are essentially looping structures that evolve over time. \u201cI use loops and rhythm to tell stories through animation, which in itself is a very time-consuming practice. So using loops also helps animators economise on time,\u201d he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile he started out with a 2D hand-drawn aesthetic, of late, he has been trying not to limit himself. \u201cI strive to have a stark graphic quality with all the projects I undertake, but at the same time, think that it\u2019s important to not get stuck with one style that can instantly be pinned to you,\u201d he adds.The online response has been quite encouraging, with a lot of projects coming in from folks who discovered his work on Instagram. He finds the demographic of his followers to be interesting, and an influx of inquiries and work from the UK is a pleasant surprise. \n\n\n         View this post on Instagram           Drawings by @deadtheduck animated by @spiralofsorts #animation #2d #studiomoebius #design #motiondesign #motiongraphics #motionbranding #vjing #visuals #liveperformance #LiveMusic #tropical #pineapple A post shared by  Studio Moebius (@studiomoebius) on Jun 12, 2019 at 9:34pm PDT \n\n\n\u00a0         View this post on Instagram           Drawings by @deadtheduck animated by @spiralofsorts #animation #2d #studiomoebius #design #motiondesign #motiongraphics #motionbranding #vjing #visuals #liveperformance #LiveMusic #tropical #pineapple A post shared by  Studio Moebius (@studiomoebius) on Jun 12, 2019 at 9:34pm PDT  Drawings by @deadtheduck animated by @spiralofsorts #animation #2d #studiomoebius #design #motiondesign #motiongraphics #motionbranding #vjing #visuals #liveperformance #LiveMusic #tropical #pineappleA post shared by  Studio Moebius (@studiomoebius) on Jun 12, 2019 at 9:34pm PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nExpect extraordinary \u2014 and slightly disconcerting \u2014 imagery on this Berlin-based art director and 3D artist\u2019s Instagram feed. As an artist, he is inspired by everyday situations. \u201cI like showing them in an ambiguous and uncomfortable way, trying to focus on provoking sensations in the viewers, forcing them to think for themselves,\u201d he says, \u201cI seek to draw attention to the things that concern or amuse me in a way or another. But rather than showing them in an explicit way, I choose to represent them in an ambiguous way, without being very obvious and always playing with the limits.\u201dSo you\u2019ll see a brain swinging in a pink hammock, accompanied by the sound of heavy breathing. Or a blobby creature walking in tune to an increasingly racing heartbeat. \n\n         View this post on Instagram           HUMAN-PASTE. #human #packaged #mass #pack #pressure #food #tube #body #stick #drop #art # #satisfying #loop #designer #animation #extraweg #houdini #instaart #creative #3d #digitalart #designspiration #instagramjapan #graficdesigncentral #communityfirst #thecolorshift @digitaldesigndays A post shared by  Oliver Latta (@extraweg) on Feb 15, 2018 at 6:14am PST \n\n\n\u00a0         View this post on Instagram           HUMAN-PASTE. #human #packaged #mass #pack #pressure #food #tube #body #stick #drop #art # #satisfying #loop #designer #animation #extraweg #houdini #instaart #creative #3d #digitalart #designspiration #instagramjapan #graficdesigncentral #communityfirst #thecolorshift @digitaldesigndays A post shared by  Oliver Latta (@extraweg) on Feb 15, 2018 at 6:14am PST  HUMAN-PASTE. #human #packaged #mass #pack #pressure #food #tube #body #stick #drop #art # #satisfying #loop #designer #animation #extraweg #houdini #instaart #creative #3d #digitalart #designspiration #instagramjapan #graficdesigncentral #communityfirst #thecolorshift @digitaldesigndaysA post shared by  Oliver Latta (@extraweg) on Feb 15, 2018 at 6:14am PST\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stockholm-based artist and art director crafts unique 3D sculptures and mesmerising looping animations he shares with over 600K followers. Describing his work, he says, \u201cMy art is all about interactions between shape and space. It\u2019s a sophisticated and whimsical portal into the perfect world of physics, movement, and predictability. Inspired by ASMR, as well as real-world mechanics and motion patterns from our everyday lives, my digital puzzles are brought to life with the help of computers and 3D software, enabling perpetual motion with an abstract touch.\u201dOver the last 14 years, he has done commissioned work for brands like Google, Adidas, Ikea, Coca-Cola, Spotify, Absolut Vodka and Red Bull. \u201cI want to transport my viewers into a meditative state, and to trigger that inexplicable feeling of odd satisfaction we all know. My art is very much influenced by the way we consume art nowadays, with the help of technology and social platforms such as Instagram. In a time when we are flooded with visual stimulation, I think short loops are optimal to attract the attention of the viewers and soothe their psyche,\u201d he adds. \n\n         View this post on Instagram           Waves Sound design: @zeligsound . #3d #design #animation #cinema4d #render #abstract #graphic #shapes #cgi #art #digitalart #instaart #wannerstedt #loop A post shared by  Andreas Wannerstedt (@wannerstedt) on Apr 6, 2019 at 8:45am PDT \n\n\n\u00a0         View this post on Instagram           Waves Sound design: @zeligsound . #3d #design #animation #cinema4d #render #abstract #graphic #shapes #cgi #art #digitalart #instaart #wannerstedt #loop A post shared by  Andreas Wannerstedt (@wannerstedt) on Apr 6, 2019 at 8:45am PDT  Waves Sound design: @zeligsound . #3d #design #animation #cinema4d #render #abstract #graphic #shapes #cgi #art #digitalart #instaart #wannerstedt #loopA post shared by  Andreas Wannerstedt (@wannerstedt) on Apr 6, 2019 at 8:45am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe co-founder of Scandinavian design duo, Part One, describes his aesthetic as \u201cseamless intricate animations with geometric designs\u201d. He pairs these quite intelligently with industrial sounds (it almost sounds like heavy machinery functioning at a factory), overlaid with metal/rock instrumental music. He often shares the making of these trippy creations on his Instagram stories to his 74.8K followers.Oscar did not set out to be an ASMR star; it was an accidental addition to his work as a 3D motion designer. \u201cI studied motion creative at Hyper Island, an international design school. After running a studio for a couple of years with some classmates, I went freelance. I love it!\u201d Clearly, it also gives him enough time to experiment, building his work in Cinema 4D, rendering with Arnold and compositing in After Effects. \n\n         View this post on Instagram           #gemetric #walk - Oscillating Oloid - Credit: Paul Schatz A post shared by  Oscar Pettersson (@0scarpettersson) on Apr 30, 2019 at 9:08am PDT \n\n\n\u00a0         View this post on Instagram           #gemetric #walk - Oscillating Oloid - Credit: Paul Schatz A post shared by  Oscar Pettersson (@0scarpettersson) on Apr 30, 2019 at 9:08am PDT  #gemetric #walk - Oscillating Oloid - Credit: Paul SchatzA post shared by  Oscar Pettersson (@0scarpettersson) on Apr 30, 2019 at 9:08am PDTAs the name suggests, this Insta-collective shares work by various artists that falls under dope, rad and cool categories. The moderators say, \u201cThe main goal behind our social platform is to give exposure to artists who are working hard to produce content they\u2019re passionate about. We look for what trends are popular with our audience, look for emerging artists within that niche artwork, and then we try to create a finely curated digital gallery. Everyone is looking for a form of escapism, we feel that digital motion graphics and animation are perfect for that because it can take anyone\u2019s most imaginative fantasy and bring it to life.\u201dThey explain that digital ASMR tends to be more edgy than traditional forms. \u201cWhile there are people that enjoy both, we\u2019ve noticed that the two audiences don\u2019t overlap as much as you might think. One thing to note is that the creators making the animated videos often create their own sounds, which can come off as \u2018unnatural\u2019, making people uncomfortable, but they still watch over and over again.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

On July 14, 1983, this video game was released by Nintendo in Japan as an arcade game. It featured an Italian-American plumber dressed in red overalls running through alien landscapes and through sewage tunnels in search of a kidnapped princess. He also had a younger brother who wore green overalls. The game designers named the lead character after the owner of their flat. What is the name of this incredibly popular video game?Mario Bros.1. Studies have found that people from this life-saving profession who played video games for more than three hours per week made 37% fewer errors and performed tasks 27% faster than their peers. It was concluded that the video games result in better hand-eye coordination, an important skill in this profession. What is this profession?Surgery1. In 2011, players of an online puzzle video game about protein folding, called Foldit, decoded the crystal structure of a retroviral protease from Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (M-PMV) in 10 days, shocking scientists who had been working on it for over 15 years. PMV causes symptoms very similar to another life-threatening disease, hence the result of this video game led to acceleration in the path to treatment of a worldwide epidemic. What is the disease?HIV/ AIDS1. SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor thoughts) is a free online video game designed with the help of researchers from the University of Auckland. In a study, it was shown to produce excellent results in helping teenagers beat a certain illness. The game guides players through a number of challenges that help practise handling various life situations and emotions that come with them. What prevalent disorder is this?Depression1. The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) assigns age and content ratings for video games. It came into existence because of a game that was released in 1992. It was originally designed as a Jean-Claude van Damme fighting game. When he wasn\u2019t able to commit his likeness, the character was changed by the designers to \u2018Johnny Cage\u2019. It was the first ever fighting game to introduce a secret fighter, the level reached if the player fulfilled a set of requirements. What is this game that has become one of the highest grossing media franchises of all time?Mortal Kombat1. This video game allows the player to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D generated world that gradually evolves. In 2012, this game partnered with UN-Habitat to offer children who did not have training in architecture the chance to design changes they would like to see in their environment. Using this platform, 300 public spaces were upgraded by the UN-Habitat\u2019s Sustainable Urban Development Network. What is this game?Minecraft1. The human reaction to a virtual pandemic simulated disease in a popular multiplayer online role-playing game so closely resembled historical records of real plagues that epidemiologists are using the data to evaluate the potential response to a future epidemic. During the epidemic, players in the game reacted as if there was real risk to their well-being. What is this popular game with a three-letter acronym?World Of Warcraft1. Starcraft is the national e-sport of South Korea, and in 2005, around 1,20,000 people gathered to watch the finals. It centres on a galactic struggle for dominance among four species. In 1999, Daniel T. Barry took a physical copy of the game with him on a particular mission he was chosen for. Fittingly, where did Barry take the game, making Starcraft the first computer game to achieve that status?Outer space1. Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity is a multiplayer adventure game that revolves around the fight between the Assassins and the Templars. It is set in Paris during the French Revolution and one of the stand-out features of the game is the incredible detail that went into modelling the landmarks that served as locations in the game. This feature turned out to be a saving grace for engineers who were looking for blueprints after a devastating fire in April 2019. What iconic landmark is being reconstructed with help from this videogame?The Notre-Dame cathedral1. Toru Iwatani is a Japanese video-game designer who in 1980 released a game in which a character has to make his way through a maze while avoiding the bad guys. Legend has it that the design was inspired by some half eaten pizza slice but Iwatani maintains it\u2019s the Japanese symbol for \u2018mouth\u2019, which plays an important role in the game. What popular arcade game is this?Pac-Man"

It didn\u2019t appear Mr. deBrauwere had any delay receiving the calls at first but players noticed a big difference. \u201cOne time I already had caught the ball back from the catcher and he signalled strike,\u201d said pitcher Daryl Thompson, who didn\u2019t realise the technology was being used until after he disagreed with a call. The umpires have the ability to override the computer, which considers a pitch a strike when the ball bounces and then crosses the zone.

      "Artificial intelligence programs have bested humans in checkers, chess, Go and two-player poker, but multi-player poker was always believed to be a bigger ask. Mission: accomplished.Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Facebook\u2019s AI initiative, has announced that their program defeated a group of top pros in six-player no-limit Texas hold \u2018em game.The program, Pluribus, and its big wins were described in the journal Science.\u201cPluribus achieved superhuman performance at multi-player poker, which is a recognised milestone in artificial intelligence and in game theory,\u201d said Tuomas Sandholm, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon.According to the creators of Pluribus, the technology could be used to solve a \u201cwide variety of real-world problems\u201d that, like in poker, involve actors who bluff, or hide key information.First, the program practiced against itself, learning little by little how to use poker moves to best advantage. Surprises cropped up. \u201cIts major strength is its ability to use mixed strategies,\u201d said Darren Elias, who played 5,000 hands against it.

      "\nIn this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talks about the Google Assistant during a product event in San Francisco.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Google contractors regularly listen to and review some recordings of what people say to artificial-intelligence system Google Assistant, via their phone or through smart speakers such as the Google Home. The company acknowledged that humans can access those recordings after some of its Dutch language audio snippets were leaked. Google product manager David Monsees acknowledged the leak in a blog post Thursday, and said the company is investigating the breach.\u201cWe are conducting a full review of our safeguards in this space to prevent misconduct like this from happening again,\u201d he wrote. More than 1,000 recordings were obtained by Belgian broadcaster VRT NWS, which noted in a story that some contained sensitive personal conversations \u2014 as well as information that identified the person speaking. Google says no user account information is associated with the recordings, and reviewers are instructed not to transcribe background conversations. But VRT reporters could hear spoken home addresses in some of the recordings, and were able to track down the speakers. Some of these conversations were not directed at Assistant and happened either as background noise or as a mistaken recording when Assistant thought it was being spoken to, but wasn\u2019t. Google says contractors listen to recordings to better understand language patterns and accents. Its user terms confirm recordings may be used by the company, stating Assistant \u201crecords your voice and audio on Google services to improve speech recognition.\u201d Monsees wrote that Google works with contractors around the world to analyze the recordings.\u201cThese language experts review and transcribe a small set of queries to help us better understand those languages,\u201d he wrote. Google\u2019s terms don\u2019t explicitly say that people review the recordings, but do state that data could be analyzed as the company updates services or create new features. The company acknowledged earlier this year that its reviewers listen to anonymous recordings in response to a Bloomberg report revealing that Amazon\u2019s Alexa also uses contractors to listen to recordings. Amazon confirmed the report. Google\u2019s recording feature can be turned off, but doing so means Assistant loses some of its personalized touch. People who turn off the recording feature lose the ability for the Assistant to recognize individual voices and learn your voice pattern. Assistant recording is actually turned off by default \u2014 but the technology prompts users to turn on recording and other tools in order to get personalized features. Google Assistant is available on more than 1 billion devices, including smartphones and smart speakers. It\u2019s made quite a dent in the smart speaker market \u2014 still the primary place where people use voice technology \u2014 but still trails behind Amazon.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nTwitter said on July 11, 2019, that it is investigating a problem with its service. Users across the U.S. and elsewhere are not able to access Twitter.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  \u201cMiss us?\u201d Twitter tweeted from its official account as the Great Twitter Outage wound down. For nearly an hour on Thursday, Twitter appeared inaccessible for people around the world, regardless of celebrity status or follower count. Some turned to Instagram, Facebook and even LinkedIn to express outrage over the outage.Then, shortly before 1 p.m. Pacific Time, it was back for many. Twitter posted an explanation on its status page blaming an \u201cinternal configuration change\u201d that it was fixing. The model Chrissy Teigen phrased the collective sigh in all caps, tweeting \u201cOH THANK GOD.\u201d Earlier, she turned to Instagram to post what looked very much like a tweet- \u201cTWITTER IS DOWN I DON\u2019T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO SAY THIS AHHHHHH.\u201dThe hashtag \u201cTwitterDown\u201d was trending as users recalled their experiences. Some were too young to remember a time when such an outage was a common occurrence. Outages were so widespread in Twitter\u2019s early years that a cartoon \u201cfail whale\u201d the company displayed during outages came to symbolise Twitter almost as much as its little blue bird icon. The whale was retired in 2013, largely because Twitter didn\u2019t want to be associated with what it represented any more.This time, Twitter\u2019s home page read in part, \u201cSomething is technically wrong. Thanks for noticing.\u201d The disruption appeared to affect both web and mobile app users. According to Down Detector, a website that tracks outages, problems were reported from the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. Facebook and Instagram have also experienced outages recently, during which time users turned to Twitter to joke and complain. But for the politicians, celebrities and other public figures who use Twitter as their main communications platform and for the people who follow them nothing quite compares with the immediate, public nature of the service. The outage came as President Donald Trump convened a White House conference of like-minded critics of Big Tech.

      "Imagine a city where commuting short distances on e-scooters was a reality! Inspired by the impact of Lime, a transportation-rental company based in the United States, Pradeep Narava, a city-based software engineer, built foldable e-scooters called Rideabird. These e-scooters have plenty going on from occupying less parking space to it\u2019s low cost of operation, but most importantly they could play a key role in reducing air pollution in Visakhapatnam. Last year in October, he introduced five scooters for joy rides near Kali Mata Temple at the Beach Road. After an overwhelming response from the public, few months later he added 10 more scooters at Indira Gandhi Children\u2019s Park, opposite Hotel Novotel at the Beach Road. The demand has been growing and now people are reaching out to him to buy the scooters. In the last four months, he has sold 20 scooters, each costing \u20b930,000, in Visakhapatnam and Kakinada. All about the rideManufacturing process Individual spare parts are ordered from China and assembled in Visakhapatnam.Features LED battery indicator; LED headlight and tail lights; IP54 dirt, dust and splash proofMax Speed Up to 24 kilometres per hour (kmph)Weight 12 kilograms; Body aerospace-grade aluminiumBattery 7800 mAh; 800 charge cycles; Distance on full charge 30 kilometres; Charging time Approx five hoursMax load Below 100 kilogramsBrakes regenerative and disk breaking Few months ago, Kishore Kumar, a local resident, purchased five scooters from Narava and started a side business at Rushikonda Beach. And the response has been encouraging, he says. \u201cEach day, I easily get 25 customers. The cost of charging five e-scooters is recovered in just one ride,\u201d he adds. According to Narava, on a full charge Rideabird can travel 100 kilometres.   \n\n\n\n\n\nHe believes foldable e-scooters can be used in our day-to-day lives as well. \u201cRideabird can be integrated by hotels on the Beach Road so that their customers can visit the points of the attraction. As of now, I\u2019m in talks with Indira Gandhi Zoological Park about integrating Rideabird where visitors can go around the zoo at their own pace,\u201d he says. Despite Rideabird\u2019s unique proposition, Narava finds it challenging to convince customers to purchase it for personal use. He feels people are yet to recognise the potential of e-vehicles. \u201cIf people keep comparing e-vehicles with the traditional vehicles, they will only see its short comings,\u201d he adds. According to Narava, until people get access to e-vehicles they will not understand its potential. He hopes his initiative will help people integrate e-vehicles in their everyday life. For instance, instead of walking or taking a rickshaw to the bus stop or metro station you can use these e-scooters. As per The Budget 2019The government will provide additional income tax deduction of \u20b91,50,000 on the interest paid for a loan taken to buy an electric vehicle.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "American tech giants Amazon and Google have called a long-overdue truce, allowing streaming of their respective video apps on each other\u2019s streaming platforms.YouTube will once again be available on Amazon Fire TV worldwide after two years. Google had blocked its popular video app Youtube on Fire TV back in 2017. While YouTube Kids and YouTube TV will be available on Amazon devices later this year, Amazon\u2019s Prime Video will be available for streaming to Google Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra dongles and Android TV sets and boxes worldwide.Now, you can download the Amazon Prime Video app directly from Google Play or through the app icon on your TV\u2019s home screen.Phones or tablets streaming Prime Video to Chromecast will need to be running versions higher than Android 5.0 or higher than iOS 10.1 to receive this latest update.The long term feud between the two multinational companies was aggravated back in 2015 when Google\u2019s Chromecast devices were made unavailable on the Amazon ecommerce website. The search result for Chromecast comprised of various Amazon products mainly Amazon Fire TV stick.A Google spokesperson commented on the issue back in 2017, \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other\u2019s products and services. But Amazon doesn\u2019t carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn\u2019t make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of [Google-owned] Nest\u2019s latest products. Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and FireTV.\u201dCome 2019, both companies seem ready to bury their hatchet, though not entirely."

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/pixel-perfect-models-virtual-influencers-could-be-the-future-of-fashion-advertising/article28331935.ece",
      "One of the reviews listed on the Rotten Tomatoes website for the sci-fi comedy drama, S1m0ne, says, \u201c[The movie] fails on all points of plot, characterisation, plausibility and realism\u2026\u201d The critics consensus on the site echoes this statement. \u201cThe satire in S1m0ne lacks bite, and the plot isn\u2019t believable enough to feel relevant.\u201dS1m0ne, released 17 years ago, is about a filmmaker\u2019s (played by Al Pacino) creation of a computer-generated actress (Rachel Roberts), who the public believe is real. The actress goes on to become more popular than her creator, which annoys the latter.One, now, cannot argue that a computer-generated human-like personality can\u2019t be more popular than an actual person. Because, well, that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happening with Lil Miquela, Shudu, Liam Nikuro and a few others.With Instagram followers ranging from over 100,000 to well in excess of a million, there\u2019s a prediction that these personalities \u2014 comprised of intricately crafted pixels \u2014 will be the future of fashion advertising. Social media influencers \u2014 people with a large following who can impact lifestyle decisions \u2014 have been around almost since the time of the social media boom, which is around the turn of the decade. Many bloggers, vloggers and online entrepreneurs are big-time social media influencers. Brands, especially of fashion, turn to these influencers for better reach. But the thing with these influencers is that the brands can\u2019t entirely control their actions. If an act of theirs irks the public, then the brand, too, might get some flak.But what if you can have an influencer, whose actions you can entirely (or mostly) control? This is one of the primary appeals of virtual social media influencers. The idea of a social media influencer \u2014 albeit a strange quirk at the intersection of fashion, commerce and advertising \u2014 is not viral. The well-known ones are just about a handful.Virtual Celebs@lilmiquela (Lil Miquela), Instagram followers: 1.6MMiquela Sousa, popularly known as Lil Miquela, is arguably the most popular virtual social media influencer. Created by a tech-design company, Brud, Miquela is projected as a forever 19, Brazilian-American fashionista and a music artiste. She has released several singles since her d\u00e9but with \u2018Not Mine\u2019.@shudu.gram (Shudu), Instagram followers: 177KShudu, dubbed as the world\u2019s first digital supermodel, is arguably the most human-looking of all the virtual influencers, with skin pores, errant strands of hair and all. Shudu is also perhaps the most controversial of her peers as she is a dark-skinned model created by a 28-year-old white man, Cameron-James Wilson.@blawko22 (Blawko), Instagram followers: 136KBlawko, unlike Shudu, can easily be identified as a 3D model. Sporting a buzz cut and face tattoos, he looks like a character out of video games. The biggest draw of Blawko is his face, which, in his one-and-a-half years of existence on Instagram, has been only partially revealed.Despite some virtual influencers hinting that they are creations of AI and/or robots, they are merely 3D puppets with their invisible strings carefully manipulated by a usually discreet CG-artist. Unlike Al Pacino\u2019s character in S1m0ne, the artist, here, is happy to take the back seat \u2014 at least, that\u2019s how it\u2019s been so far. Having said that, big bucks are at play when it comes to virtual influencers. According to TechCrunch, Lil Miquela\u2019s creators, in January, had closed a $125 million investment round led by Spark Capital. Juniper Research estimates that the global fashion industry, perhaps inspired by the artificial models\u2019 considerable success, will invest $3.6 billion in artificial intelligence technology this year.The concept of virtual influencers has not made its mark in India. The reason is not easily pinpointable. \u201cIt\u2019s puzzling, isn\u2019t it? But I don\u2019t think virtual influencers will be a thing in India,\u201d says Riaan George, the editor of Business Traveller India and a social media influencer with an Instagram following of over 35,000. \u201cWe are highly advanced in technology now. So, if we were to adopt that, we would already have done that,\u201d he says.Swathi Mukund, blogger and another influencer (with over 59,000 Instagram followers), reckons Indians will relate to an actual person than a manufactured persona. \u201cFor instance, I can inspire my followers by posting videos of my run\u2026 They know where I go for a run. I can meet my followers face-to-face. They know that I am real and it helps them relate to me. I am not sure if it will be the same with a virtual person,\u201d she says.As George says, \u201cIt will be interesting though if they do come to India.\u201dByte-sized play-by-plays of tech conceptsYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHarry Potter Wizards Unite review: Spell of good times\n\n",
      "Updated: July 9, 2019 13:00 IST\rPublished: July 9, 2019 13:00 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/harry-potter-wizards-unite-review-spell-of-good-times/article28328704.ece",
      "In the days since Harry Potter: Wizards Unite launched globally, I have saved a desk from a whirlwind in my bedroom, rescued a horse from a giant snake at the loo in a mall, brewed some potions at one of our quarterly review meetings and saved a gnomish banker from a nasty curse at the same time. As you can tell by my not using the proper magic terminology, I am not a so-called Potterhead. Yet, I was not even a big Pok\u00e9fan to begin with, and now you will find me taking down legendary Pok\u00e9mon with my own Pok\u00e9mon that I have lovingly named and talk to sometimes. Wizards Unite may not have had the meteoric rise of Pok\u00e9mon Go, but it\u2019s a great game with an excellent community. The entire premise of the game is around the fact that magic has leaked into the muggle (non-magic) realm, and all manner of items, known as Foundables, from the wizarding realm, have been held hostage by magical powers, known as Confoundables. So, you, a bona fide wizard, have to rescue these magical artefacts as well as people. Familiar faces from the books and movies, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, show up along the way. Unlike Pok\u00e9mon Go, Wizards Unite has a semblance of a story and comes in with a truckload of style and substance. From beautifully realised creatures to detailed spells, the game jumps out at you.Developer: Niantic Inc, Portkey GamesPublisher: Niantic Inc, Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, WB GamesPrice: Free on Android and iOSCapturing beasts would have been a logical step forward, given Niantic\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon roots and the recent Fantastic Beasts movies. However, Wizards Unite carves a whole new niche for itself within the same technological confines. You still walk about with your GPS on to complete various activities, so it\u2019s hard not to compare it with Pok\u00e9mon Go. However, at a certain point, Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s random number generator drains the pool of Pok\u00e9mon to catch or healing items to collect. Wizards Unite has a whole lot of things for you to do. If there are no Confoundables on the map, then you can brew potions, take on fortresses, plant seeds and take up various schools of magic.If you\u2019re not familiar with the wizarding realm, the game is a tad overwhelming but it completely makes sense to the various Potterheads among friends and family. My wife actually cries out the spell names as she tracks her finger on a simple pattern that launches the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prospect of rescuing items and people to get bonuses is fan service at its best. The application of Augmented Reality is the best part of the game, and it\u2019s best played with AR mode on, to see the gorgeously animated creatures flit about, blending into reality seamlessly. Where the game loses big is in the abysmal load times, even on a beefy brand new flagship smartphone. Unless you choose to save a whopping 3 GB of files on your phone\u2019s storage (Hey, good visuals come at a price!) The other minus point is that most of the game has you wade through ugly menus that are overwhelming and unfriendly at best. The best way to learn is to jump right in and figure things out yourself.Wizards Unite is certainly the best Harry Potter game out there. If you\u2019re a fan, you will be in for a treat. If not, it\u2019s a damn good excuse to get off your chair and explore your city and have some fun.

The telecom department will approach the minister for its launch after the Parliament session. It should be launched in the next month,\u201d a DoT official told PTI.The ongoing Parliament session will run till July 26.The Department of Telecom (DoT) had assigned the mobile phone tracking project \u201cCentral Equipment Identity Register (CEIR)\u201d aimed at bringing down counterfeit cellphones and discouraging theft to C-DoT in July 2017.The government has proposed to allocate Rs 15 crore for setting up CEIR in the country that will bring down the number of counterfeit handsets and discourage theft.The CEIR system will block all services on stolen or lost mobile phones on any network even if the SIM card is removed or IMEI number of the handset is changed.The system is also expected to protect consumer interest and facilitate law enforcement authorities for lawful interception.It will connect the IMEI database of all mobile operators. It will act as a central system for all network operators to share blacklisted mobile terminals so that devices placed under the said category in one network will not work on the other, even if the SIM card in the device is changed, it said.IMEI number - a unique 15-digit serial number of mobile devices - is allocated by global industry body GSMA and bodies authorised by it. When a mobile phone is lost, the victim is required to mention the IMEI number of the handset for tracking.\u201d The pilot project (of CEIR) was carried out in Maharashtra,\u201d the official said.

      "Imagine this: up to 100 financial investors gathered together at a conference. Yes, they\u2019re in their usual suits and ties, but they\u2019re actually here to play a game \u2014 an experiential simulation that is aptly titled The Game of Tomorrow, and is set in the future.This is the scene at the St Regis in Mumbai last month, at the Future Bets Conference organised by Ashika Group, a financial services company. \u201cWe wanted to give our investors access to the future,\u201d explains Chirag Jain, CEO of Ashika Capital, a subsidiary outfit. \u201cAnd help them understand that changes happening around the world will come to India sooner than expected.\u201dTo bring this vision to life, Jain reached out to 64/1, the Bengaluru-based art and experience collective helmed by artist Raghava KK and his brother, Karthik Kalyanaraman. Watching their months-long effort come to life was a magical feeling, says Raghava (38), on a phone call from New York, where he is attending an artist residency. \u201cI could see one of the biggest traders in the country getting very nervous during the game, jumping from counter to counter and talking to people,\u201d he remembers. \u201cSomeone making big decisions for the country being so engaged in this \u2014 it was like watching a movie.\u201d In the game, traders are required to do their everyday jobs, but in a fast-changing environment. It opens in the present day, jumping every five minutes to the following year. There are constant updates in the form of news announcements, social media posts and even performance art. Climactic calamities are introduced, artificial intelligence makes jobs obsolete, new wars are being won, and understandably, stock prices are reacting. Who will manage to maintain the most valuable portfolio in a world like this one?Kalyanaraman (40), who has taught econometrics at the University College London, among other places, reveals that the game was born out of a desire to make sense of these transitions. \u201cI don\u2019t think any generation before ours \u2014 including the pre-Industrial Revolution era \u2014 saw this much rapid change,\u201d he says, citing examples like higher mobile penetration and the advent of cryptocurrency and AI. \u201cDuring such times, we passively leave our future to technologists.\u201d Thinking about these macro-level transitions was spurred in part by his personal life, he admits. \u201cRaghava and I went through the failures of our own marriages a few years ago, and moved back to Bengaluru. We started thinking about change and the future we were creating.\u201d This is where longtime collaborator and futurist Nihal Ahmed (28) comes in. His background as a game designer and creator of experiential futures was driven by his motivation to help people gear up for what might lie ahead. \u201cYou shock them with these experiences, and that registers in their mind a lot more, helping them prepare better, asking themselves, \u2018how do we steer clear of a dystopian future?\u2019\u201dAnd that\u2019s really what the creators of the game \u2014 including experience designers Alrex Romer (also a policy expert) and Janet Orlene \u2014 want: for key decision makers to think about tomorrow. \u201cWill we even have banks in the future, without governments propping them up?\u201d asks Kalyanaraman, who built data sets drawn from existing research to create these futuristic scenarios.As for the future, Chirag Jain wants to take the game to more of the company\u2019s investors, perhaps in Singapore and Dubai, and set up mini salons across the country with thought leaders and public market investors who are thinking about \u201cthe stock market of the future\u201d.

In the past, hacking videos in years past could be removed if enough viewers submitted reports objecting to them or if moderators found the videos violated other articulated policies.\u201cNow that there\u2019s a written rule, there\u2019s renewed concern about how the policy is being applied,\u201d The Register reported on Wednesday.A security researcher and educator named Kody Kinzie who uploads hacking videos to YouTube\u2019s \u201cNull Byte\u201d channel, on Tuesday reportedly said a video created for the U.S. July 4 holiday to demonstrate launching fireworks over Wi-Fi couldn\u2019t be uploaded because of the new change.\u201cI\u2019m worried for everyone that teaches about infosec and tries to fill in the gaps for people who are learning. It is hard, often boring, and expensive to learn cybersecurity,\u201d he tweeted.Mr. Kinzie clarified that YouTube had problems with three previous videos, which got flagged and are either in the process of review or have already been appealed and restored, according to The Register.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0 There\u2019s a part in Judgment during which our hero Takayuki Yagami \u2014 while staggering, beaten and bruised \u2014 looks at a bunch of Yakuza, muttering the words \u201cYou guys have had your turn,\u201d before yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now!\u201dA direct reference to the Yakuza series, the flagship games of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the masters of mellodramatic beat-em-ups that are so pulpy and good, it\u2019s hard to put down. After a decent goodbye to their righteous hero Kazuma Kiryu in a lacklustre Yakuza 6, Judgment marks a new beginning with a fresh new face.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTakayuki Yagami was one of the best lawyers out there, who quit soon after he found out that he was responsible for setting a serial killer free. Starting his own detective agency, he\u2019s sworn to make amends and find the person responsible... to find this killer with a penchant for poking out nice folks\u2019 eyes, and bring this person to justice.JudgmentDeveloper: Ryu Ga Gotoku StudioPublisher: SegaPrice: \u20b92,999 for PlayStation 4Set in the familiar district that\u2019s become the staple of the Yakuza series, Kamurocho, Judgment features an all-new cast of characters that are more down-to-earth, telling a tale that is darker, and unlike anything the series is known for. Takayuki himself is a really good character with a roguish charm about him, who along with his partner Kaito, an ex-Yakuza, makes quite the team as they descend into the seedy underbelly of a seedy part of Japan. Those who shied away from the subtitled Japanese of the previous games will be happy to know that it\u2019s got English voices too, but there\u2019s a certain charm of hearing the original performances in Japanese.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nA few hours into the game and we have just one question on our minds, how does Yagami, a desk jockey lawyer, have intense martial arts training, especially proficient in three fighting styles. Some of it is answered in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with his boss, where it\u2019s mentioned that he was a street thug before becoming a lawyer. Yet, it\u2019s something of which we just can\u2019t quite get a hang of. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the action is fantastic, going back to the fun of Yakuza 0 and we would accept it if his fighting style was anything thug-like... yet Yagami breaks out some crazy acrobatic fighting techniques that no law school would ever teach.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, most of the game has you doing detective stuff, which involves skulking around, tailing people, finding clues, doing a lot of investigating, all done in various mini-games that are a fun take on the hard-boiled detective genre. Then there are the lawyer parts which have you use your evidence against various parties to call them out on their crimes with proof, playing out like Ace Attorney, which I covered fairly recently. Then there are the engaging cut-scenes that play out like fine wine. After that, you have Yagami go stomp on a bunch of thugs\u2019 heads with kung fu, while you rub your head at the transition.Kamurocho proves to be the real hero of the game with a multitude of things to do in its neon and rain-soaked streets. You can walk around the city and play a bunch of mini games as well as meet a whole bunch of colourful folks from either side of the law. As you take on the Yakuza, crooked cops and everything in between.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Judgement by Sega\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the two halves of the game share an uneasy coexistence, Judgment is a long and meaty crime game that is full of repetitive chase sequences and fights, but it more than makes up for it with its clever cases and engrossing storyline.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAccessible home automation, by a group of Delhi high-schoolers\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/accessible-home-automation-by-a-group-of-delhi-high-schoolers/article28259602.ece",
      "\n(L-R) Aryan Chand, Aryan Srivastava, Neil Dey, and Akaash Parthasarathy\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n When they joined the LaunchX club in their school in July last year, Neil Dey (17), Akaash Parthsarathy (14), Aryan Srivastava (14), and Aryan Chand (15) thought their interest in tech would carry them through. Dey was in Class XI, and the rest were in Class IX. Once in the programme, this band of students from Shri Ram School, Aravali, Gurugram, realised there were different nuances within tech that appealed to each of them. LaunchX, an independent high-school-level offshoot of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Launch, is a fully planned course-load, alongside regular school work. Its mission is \u201cto empower young people to build the future\u201d, and to give them \u201cthe entrepreneurial skills and mindset to start real companies\u201d. Through the pre-programme test and course work phases, Dey found that he engaged with tech best through a business development perspective; Parthasarathy realised he was good with numbers and with money; Srivastava, that he has a knack to understand the tech market; and Chand, his passion for the nitty gritty of the tech itself.It is this alchemy of talents, brought together as their startup-in-the-making Swifi, that saw them through the Asia finals of LaunchX in Bangkok this March. Here, Swifi, which makes affordable home automation systems with manual control options in case of Wi-Fi failure, was given the Top Inventor and Global Finalist titles, pushing them to qualify for the main summer LaunchX programme at MIT later in May.Thinking of privacySwifi believes that \u201ceventually, we\u2019re moving into a world where every little bit about us is going to be available to everyone.\u201d Having said that, they have thought of the data that their devices collect. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything to protect privacy \u2014 the data is not even going to be accessible to us, only to the device,\u201d Dey says.Both these events were like Shark Tank, the popular American reality TV show that gives aspiring entrepreneurs a chance to pitch their products to a panel of insanely wealthy investors. Except here, the young entrepreneurs get sustained mentorship and connections instead of investors.\u201cThe idea is to help us prep for and build an actual company, which solves an existing problem in the market at the end of the day. It\u2019s not just about a \u2018school project\u2019,\u201d explains Chand.Home automation, the tech that lets you switch your electrical appliances on and off remotely, isn\u2019t really a new concept at all. But its adoption rate in India is low and slow. The sheer expense of making a home \u2018smart\u2019 is the primary reason.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototypes of Swifi\u2019s devices\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis adds to the mindset that people have right now, where they just don\u2019t see the point of home automation. Not only is it convenient, but it also helps you gain insights into your power usage patterns, especially if the device comes with an app, like ours does,\u201d says Dey. \u201cPeople are more willing to experience it if it\u2019s a small investment, so cost-efficiency is a massive selling point.\u201dTo tackle this price barrier, Swifi sources all parts of their standard switch-board-sized device from the local electronics market. This reduces their overheads. Additionally, instead of investing in an injection mould right away to make the device, they\u2019re currently only 3D-printing. \u201cWe\u2019ll only invest in a one-time injection moulding once this is finalised,\u201d Dey says.Giants like Philips Hue offer only individual smart lights between \u20b92,500 and \u20b93,000. Another competitor, Sonoff, has a device much like Swifi\u2019s, which can control four to eight smart appliances for a price of \u20b98,000; however, Swifi\u2019s device distinguishes itself in this segment not only with a lower price (\u20b92,500 to \u20b93,000), but also by offering control to bigger appliances like air-conditioners and geysers. The team has also added a remote-control for the devices, in addition to their compatibility with smart assistants like Google Home and Alexa, as well as an in-house app.Still self-funded and helped along through the resources of family and friends, the four students behind Swifi are now planning to participate in national competitions such as Techronext, an ICT conclave by the Punjab Public School in Nabha, Patiala. They will also soon start a crowd-funding campaign to be able to take it to market. The immediate aim is to start selling their devices by the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year.

      "\n\nPlatforms like Reverie and Vokal are digitising Indian languages\n\n",

      "\nGoing beyong the ABCs of regional languages \u00a0 Keeping up with technology can be disorienting \u2014 no wonder cyber-caf\u00e9s seem like they are from Prehistoric eras. But not all industries have seen a transformation like the telecommunications industry... and regional Indian language is one such industry. Even if we combine the types of fonts for 11 most spoken Indian languages, it still falls drastically short of the plethora of English fonts. As a result, the playing field for regional content producers is far from level.\n\n\n\n\n\nReverie Language Technologies improves local language fonts \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDesigning Indian language fonts isn\u2019t a problem, but its interaction with existing technology is. The technology or format used for Indian language fonts is OpenType (made by Microsoft and Adobe), which deviated from the previous format and grammar guidelines significantly. Since these rules can\u2019t be customised, it takes time to build Indic fonts,\u201d says Vivekanand Pani, co-founder of Reverie Language Technologies (RLT). According to Vivekanand, it\u2019s crucial for India to build technologies to make it easier for developers to use local language fonts. When RLT first entered the space of localising content in 2009, the demand for local language fonts was booming, with rapid growth in the smartphone industry. RLT eventually recognised the high demand for regional language fonts. In 2010, it offered fonts and display solutions for the electronic programme guides were displayed on set-top boxes. In the next four years, they integrated all Indian languages on the Qualcomm platform and established links with the original equipment manufacturer for Indian-language fonts. In 2014, RLT offered language solutions to Micromax. \n\n\n\n\n\nReverie Language Technologies helped phone manufactures add local languages \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to achieve accurate translations, RLT doesn\u2019t reply based on only computer-assisted translation but also professional linguistics. \u201cEvery language has its own nuances. We understand the importance of recognising context while translating,\u201d says Vivekanand. In fact, Indian Software Product Industry RoundTable approached them after demonetisation in 2016 to localise text strings in BHIM, a mobile payment App developed by the National Payments Corporation of India, based on the Unified Payments Interface.\u201cOver 20% of our users prefer to use the app in their native language. Reverie\u2019s services have helped us gain access to customers,\u201d says Himanshu Periwal, vice president of growth at travel and hotel booking e-commerce website Ixigo. Over the last seven years, RLT has managed to work with large clients like Vijaya Bank, UrbanClap, Ola, Government of Karnataka, Government of Rajasthan, Ixigo and others. Currently, RLT supports Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Assamese, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. In August, RLT will launch the updated version of Prabandhak, an AI-powered translation marketplace with an Indic spell-check feature. Prabandhak can be used by companies or individuals.In the long run, RLT intends to work with government regulatory bodies to establish Indian language standards that are not only suited for Indian languages but also defined and owned by India.A little over a year old, Vokal, a knowledge-sharing app, has over a million downloads already \u2014 most of the user base coming from the North Indian belt of tier 2 cities. The app, initially available in just Hindu, recently expanded to 11 Indian languages: Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Oriya, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi and Assamese.You can ask questions related to politics, philosophy, health and beauty, finance, relationships, or even the evergreen: tips to crack the UPSC exam. The answers are given by experts who are curated by Bengaluru-based founders, Mayank Bidawatka and Aprameya Radhakrishna, who was also behind the cab aggregator TaxiForSure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFounders of Vokal, Mayank Bidawatka and Aprameya Radhakrishna \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also sections for polls, biographies, general knowledge quizzes, and shareable facts and quotes. So yes, you can expect more of those WhatsApp family group forwards.\u201cAfter the boom in internet connectivity in India post Jio, there are 400 million internet subscribers, and that number is expected to rise. Most of these new smartphone users don\u2019t speak in English,\u201d says Mayank. \u201cFor entertainment, they have TikTok and YouTube, for news they have local apps, but we are aggregating everything, even generic life lessons, friendly advice, on to one platform.\u201dThink of it as an Indianised version of Quora \u2014 as if it could get any more Indian than it is now! Or even an Indian Reddit. However, here\u2019s the key difference: the entire app is clearly audio-video forward.\u201cWe have regular Quora users also on our app, and here they are 10 times more active. Why? Because of the ease of it. You ask anyone, would they rather read an answer, or listen to it, people will go for the latter. Even those who contribute answers prefer answering over video than text; it\u2019s the natural way,\u201d Mayank says.It\u2019s not officialDespite the many languages spoken in the United States of America, the country does not have an official language.The idea behind Vokal, he emphasises, is enabling content creation and helping people by providing trustworthy answers to questions they would not have easily had in their mother tongues. With features such as Ask Directly, a person can get immediate access to an expert in the field.But here rises a risk: who do we consider an \u2018expert\u2019? While Mayank claims that they approach people who are well-established names in the field, say in the field of health, a Head of Department would be considered an expert. However, a test run of the Hindi section throws up multiple answers in which the \u2018experts\u2019 masquerade opinions as facts.To be fair, it does open avenues for discussion, but the power balance is heavily in favour of those deemed experts. Given that the app just started in other languages, it remains to be seen if the trend shifts depending on regional politics.One thing is for sure: there is no better feel for the myriad dreams, aspirations, and concerns of the Indian multitude than an app that promotes discussion in local languages. For this, English just won\u2019t do.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\nIndia's Mohammed Shami (C) walks off the pitch with teammates after his five wicket haul at the end of the England innings during the 2019 Cricket World Cup group stage match between England and India at Edgbaston in Birmingham, central England, on June 30, 2019\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP\n Sitting in a popular watering hole in Jubilee Hills on an overcast Sunday, I\u2019m just about to sip my drink and catch the cricket match unfolding on the huge screen when I hear a furious debate raging at the table next to me. And no, the discussion among the teenagers isn\u2019t about whether Kedar Jadhav is bowling or not, not even about the field placement, but rather the colour of the jerseys of our men in blue, errrrr, orange.Belonging to the generation when white meant test cricket and blue signified one day international, I find it amusing to see hashtags of #BleedOrange or #OrangeIsTheNewBlue take over social media. But not everyone is amused. Die-hard cricket fan, 46-year-old investment banker, Sridhar Rao, finds it odd that the national team couldn\u2019t pick a better colour palette. \u2018After watching countless matches and cheering for our men in blue, I find it ridiculous that the shift to orange has been made arbitrarily. Cricket is all about the experience and this unseemly change does not help matters,\u201d he opines.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the many memes shared about the jersey\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint out that the Indian players are wearing an orange-blue jersey to distinguish themselves from hosts England, who wear a lighter version of blue because ICC has suggested that if there is a clash in the colour of the jerseys, the away team will have to wear alternate colours, he dismisses it with a wave of his hand. He questions, \u201cIs this is the best our National team can come up with?\u201dAs social media decodes the hidden meaning in the choice of the colour (saffron) and memes are spouting by the dozens, not everyone is unhappy with the new jerseys. Among the youngsters at the brewery, 18-year-old engineering graduate, Sai Kishore \u2018digs\u2019 the new jerseys and calls them \u2018cool\u2019. His friend, Abhishek Nori adds, \u201cI quite like the colour of the jersey as I think it signifies the passion our young team has to win and is a tribute to their high energy levels. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just a jersey.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the many memes shared about the jersey\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith social media split right down to the middle with people either loving or hating it \u2014 and memes circulated comparing the hapless cricketers to even Bournvita cans and Indian Oil uniforms \u2014 the jerseys have also given rise to a flurry of videos of orange uniforms of the women\u2019s football teams in the Netherlands being mistaken for those of the Indian cricket team. It\u2019s a reminder to fans to not mindlessly retweet what\u2019s floating around online.There was a considerable number of extreme reactions, one of which had the jerseys labelled bad luck. Needless to say, one can be certain that this is a storm that isn\u2019t going to die down soon.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "While some of us are still recovering from a Pok\u00e9mon Go hangover, Niantic Inc has unleashed its latest: Harry Potter Wizards Unite, which pretty much had every spellbound Potter fan whipping out their imaginary wands \u2014 we mean, smartphones \u2014 to play the magical game in which you are to banish enemies, rescue friends and digitally Apparate around your city.Otherworldly statsCurrently, the game is ranked second on Apple App Store\u2019s list of role-playing games, and there have been 5,000,000-plus installs so far (which could also include Beta versions) via Google Play.HPWU works along the lines of Pok\u00e9mon Go; hold up your phone and you are deployed virtual images over real-world objects. The overlay works in real-time with the input received from your phone\u2019s camera. So you can assume the dangers that may come with such a \u2018distraction-cum-attraction\u2019; safety warnings in the form of news analyses and social media posts littered the Internet, and given the PUBG mayhem with the Indian courts, the fears of AR-driven games are legitimate.And just as predicted HPWU does make you do some outlandish things, which the quotidian version of yourself wouldn\u2019t be caught dead doing \u2014 if the country\u2019s existing mobile data speeds allow it.Here are some reactions from our own MetroPlus folks, who are probably still glued to their phones:Divya Kala Bhavani, Hyderabad\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I was about to tell the driver to make a left turn, I got distracted by two Doxies having a tug-of-war with a shrivelled Hand Of Glory, the magical world\u2019s best friend to thieves and plunderers. I lost all sense of present, missed the turning and proceeded to casts spells to snatch the Dark Arts Foundable. That is, if your phone doesn\u2019t overheat.Upon inaugurating the game at my office desk, I was alerted that I was moving too fast and I shouldn\u2019t be driving. Glitch right off the bat \u2014 or broom, rather. That\u2019s how Harry Potter Wizards Unite (HPWU) by Niantic Inc kicked into gear. While figuring this out, I got an excitement-filled text from a friend who found an adorably soulful Mooncalf by Charminar.In Hyderabad, there\u2019s nothing like pulling over off the main road in pre-rain traffic to run to a mirchi-bajji stall and tell the vendor, \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d in my trademark broken Telugu, while you overpower a curse to return a Remembrall to Neville Longbottom. I overheard some whispers of \u2018this woman is a witch\u2019, but this is so worth the screams from fussy commuters who can\u2019t get home fast enough after a long work day.Priyadarshini Paitandy, Chennai \n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter Wizards Unite recommends you don\u2019t drive while playing \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOn busy Nungambakkam High Road, amidst whizzing cars, two-wheelers and autos, there lurks an otherworldly creature: the Mooncalf. This little blue-eyed Confoundable is also the reason I spend \u20b9200 on a taxi, instead of driving to my next destination. Driving and AR-ing isn\u2019t advisable.So here I am inside a cab, looking rather undignified as I try to unchain Mooncalf and send it back to the world of wizards in Ireland.I\u2019m currently seated in a posture that resembles a complex yoga pose: back towards the driver, one foot on the seat and head turned in an Annabelle-like fashion, as I try to cast the Alohomora spell. The Harry Potter soundtrack blares loudly from my phone, and the driver, after 15 minutes, politely enquires, \u201cAdhu enna satham, ma?\u201d (What sound is that?)Praveen Sudevan, Bengaluru\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter Wizards Unite\u2019s Incendio spell in action \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I missed out on the Pok\u00e9mon Go craze due to a terminally-ill smartphone that struggled to stay on for even two hours. By the time I switched to a new one, the people I knew had moved on. Despite knowing the basic workings of an AR game, I was mildly thrilled to see Hagrid, on my bed, tangled in an Acromantula web. I cast a Diffindo spell (swipe a diagonal \u2018Z\u2019) to free him. I expected an invitation for an evening tea in his wooden hut at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. But we, it seems, aren\u2019t that close yet.For my next mission, I had to release a Hufflepuff student trapped inside an iceberg in front of a pharmacy. Despite the pharmacist\u2019s baffled look, I, with my phone in front of him, cast an Incendio spell (after two unsuccessful attempts) to save the boy.\u201cYes, what do you want?\u201d asked the pharmacist.\u201cNothing\u2026 thanks,\u201d I quickly exited the place.\n\n\n\n\n\nVangmayi Parakala, New DelhiIt\u2019s a 42\u00b0C summer day in Delhi (the \u2018feels like\u2019 is at 46\u00b0C, in case you\u2019re the kind that looks for nuance), but I\u2019ve just stumbled onto a Marauder\u2019s Map stuck in a Confoundable storm. It feels like a whole other reality has overlapped onto mine \u2014 it has, only, it\u2019s the augmented kind. It\u2019s also one that\u2019s bringing much-needed magic on a dreary summer day \u2014 the precipitation aside, I mean, with the Marauder\u2019s Map.Right now, there\u2019s not a single person braving this mid-morning heat, so I cast a spell, unabashed. I half-moon-zig-zag my finger across my phone screen to do a Meteolojinx Recanto. The storm \u2018Counfoundable\u2019 (a curse that basically confounds the wizard\u2019s ability to return the magical found-object to its rightful place) lifts when I overpower it with my spell-casting skills. Great, it says. I have helped Harry Potter, by returning the map to him. I haven\u2019t been this invested in JK Rowling\u2019s universe for almost a decade now.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter Wizards Unite loading screen\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet, in true netizen fashion, has already launched its own sub-Reddit page, complete with how-to guides, hacks and, of course, memes. We won\u2019t go into details; if you\u2019re a member of the Potterverse, it\u2019s only fair you experience it and become just as spellbound!The work space too in Chennai\u2019s HQ is full of thrills on a working Saturday, thanks to the game. While most of us are convinced we will find Voldemort comfortably seated on the boss\u2019s chair, for now what we did find is poor old Hagrid tangled in a web."

      "Updated: June 28, 2019 15:28 IST\rPublished: June 28, 2019 07:46 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jony-ive-the-designer-behind-the-iphone-is-leaving-apple/article28194762.ece",
      "\nJony Ive\n\u00a0 The man behind the iconic designs of the iPhone, iMac and iPad is leaving Apple. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is departing after more than two decades at Apple to start his own design firm, the company said Thursday. But he\u2019s not completely severing ties with the company he has worked at for nearly 30 years. Apple said it will be one of Mr. Ive\u2019s clients at his new firm.The Cupertino, California, company did not give an exact date for his departure. Mr. Ive has been a fixture on Apple\u2019s design team since the early 1990s and is known for shaping Apple\u2019s signature rounded, stylish designs. Mr. Ive joined the company in 1992 as a young senior designer. Apple\u2019s co-founder and longtime leader Steve Jobs was in the midst of his 12-year exile at the time, and upon his return he named Mr. Ive senior vice president of industrial design. The pair were known to work closely together in the decades before Jobs\u2019 death in 2011 once, Mr. Jobs referred to Ive as his \u201cspiritual partner.\u201d Walter Isaacson, who wrote the 2011 biography \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d quotes the Jobs describing Mr. Ive as \u201cwickedly intelligent in all ways.\u201d \u201cHe gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product. And he understands that Apple is a product company. He is not just a designer,\u201d Jobs told Isaacson. \u201cHe has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me.\u201d The name for Mr. Ive\u2019s new design company, LoveFrom, comes from something Jobs once said to him, Mr. Ive told the Financial Times in an interview published Thursday. Mr. Jobs said making something with \u201clove and care\u201d was a fundamental component and doing so meant you were \u201cexpressing your gratitude to humanity, to the species.\u201d \u201cI so identified with that motivation and was moved by his description,\u201d Mr. Ive said. Ive, Isaacson wrote, is a fan of the German industrial designer Dieter Rams, who \u201cpreached the gospel of \u2018less but better.\u2019\u201d Apple\u2019s designs, led by Ive, have become synonymous with elegant simplicity. \u201cSimplicity isn\u2019t just a visual style,\u201d Ive told Isaacson. \u201cIt\u2019s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep.\u201d Ive was eventually promoted to his head of design role, where he shaped the simplistic and people-friendly phones and computers for which Apple has become known. Ive had a say in it all, from the bright, rounded iMacs of the 1990s to the sleek, silver and black iPhones of today. In more recent years, Ive put part of his focus into designing the company\u2019s giant spaceship-like campus, Apple Park. Mr. Ive, who grew up outside London, was knighted at Buckingham Palace in 2012. He studied design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University) in Newcastle, England, and founded his own design company called Tangerine work that would lead him to Apple.

      "\n\nFacebook enlists plain English to clarify how it makes money \n",
      "Updated: June 27, 2019 21:01 IST\rPublished: June 27, 2019 21:00 IST",

      "\nThe Like logo on a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California on April 25, 2019.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Facebook is updating its terms and services guidelines to clarify how it makes money from the personal information of its users. The changes reflect its ongoing attempts to satisfy regulators in the U.S. and Europe, which have urged the company to make sure users know what they are signing up for. The guideline changes, announced on June 27, are largely cosmetic. The updates don\u2019t change Facebook\u2019s underlying policies. Facebook has come under fire with regulators in Europe, and increasingly in the U.S., for how it handles personal information collected on its site and how transparent it is with users. The company said it made the updates after working with a European consumer protection group and regulators around the world. The European Commission noted Facebook\u2019s agreement to make the changes in April, saying the commission requested changes \u201cto clearly inform consumers how the social network gets financed\u201d. This is how Facebook\u2019s new guidelines tackle that challenge: \u201cInstead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products.\u201d The terms and services spell out that even if users delete material from the site, it might still exist on Facebook\u2019s servers for 90 days. It also makes clear that violating the company\u2019s policies could get posts removed from the site and explains that users still own the material they post online, although Facebook may use it. But at nearly 10 pages long in PDF form, Facebook is still facing the most common problem with lengthy terms and services people rarely read them. Facebook will issue a blog post on the changes, which go into effect July 31, but won\u2019t require users to agree again to the updated terms. It also won\u2019t promote the updates on people\u2019s Facebook feeds. The company said it decided not to make people re-sign the agreement because the changes merely clarify existing policy and don\u2019t change it. Facebook, along with other big internet companies, have been increasingly scrutinised in 2018 about how well they protect people\u2019s data and how they profit from it.

      "\n\nTata Sky Binge review: Yet another entertainment portal\n\n",
      "Updated: June 24, 2019 21:19 IST\rPublished: June 24, 2019 21:19 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/tata-sky-binge-review-yet-another-entertainment-portal/article28127936.ece",
      "Watching IPL and the ICC Cricket World Cup now just doesn\u2019t have the thrilling fun it used to back in the day. Now we have to bear the advertisements shoved in our line of vision; it\u2019s simply not enough that the field, uniforms and screens blatantly blare the sponsorships, but each precious over is interrupted by a cheesy commercial, brainwashing us to buy the next smartphone or the next paint for that one wall in our living rooms. Entertainment has changed the game, making the most of the openly-available Internet bandwidths to embrace streaming and video-on-demand (VOD) services. That\u2019s why Tata Sky Binge entered the playing field \u2014 pun totally intended. With a monthly fee of \u20b9249, subscribers now have access to videos. The review device I received was a limited-edition Amazon Fire TV Stick with the Tata Sky graphics spewed across it; as a consumer, you simply rent the Fire TV Stick (which has an MRP of \u20b93999) but pay only the \u20b9249 a month for the Tata Sky Binge. For those trying to save for an Amazon Fire TV Stick, this could be a useful hack... but you have to have a set-top-box. I don\u2019t need to name the other VOD services which run independently from their set-top-boxes because, well, not everyone finds the need to invest in one. Besides, if I already have a Fire TV Stick, wouldn\u2019t the app be free to download if the subscription is paid?Content-wise, it took me only a few minutes of browsing to really know that I wasn\u2019t exactly their target market; as someone who wants the latest content but doesn\u2019t watch television per se, there wasn\u2019t much of a thrill. But Tata Sky Binge does offer a fair share of the programmes we may miss on television while we\u2019re at work, such as cricket highlights or the latest episode of that slap-filled soap opera. According to the company, there are over 5000 titles in the library from which to choose, plus you \u2014 of course \u2014 get the premium content from the apps you still have to pay for, like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Tata Sky Binge content, however, has a seven-day shelf-life, proving this is actually to play \u2018catch up\u2019 on a rainy day rather than a full-blown entertainer night in with friends. Sure, my mind wasn\u2019t blown by this service, but there is a community to which Tata Sky Binge caters, which is probably why it\u2019s only at \u20b9249 a month. My advice? Test it out first if there\u2019s a store near you. You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\n\u2018I think humans will become cyborgs in future\u2019\n\n",
      "Updated: June 24, 2019 21:14 IST\rPublished: June 24, 2019 21:13 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/where-will-man-take-us-author-atul-jalan-says-humans-can-be-immotal/article28127844.ece",
      "Growing up in Calcutta in the 80s, Atul Jalan was introduced to reading with Russian literature (\u201cperhaps due to the commie influence of that time,\u201d he guesses). In class seven, he says, he was familiar with the works of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Chekhov. Soon, he moved on to science fiction \u2014 HG Wells, Isaac Assimov, Arthur C Clarke who fascinated young Atul endlessly. He, then, wished he lived in an era of a major technological revolution so he could witness a great change taking place in the world. Three decades later, Atul, now a tech entrepreneur (he is the founder-CEO of an Artificial Intelligence venture, Manthan), believes he\u2019s living on the cusp of the upheaval of human species. And to capture this paradigm shift, Atul has written the book, Where Will Man Take Us?, which explores the astonishing changes technology is bringing about in us.MetroPlus asks him to elaborate on the possibilities of five dramatic future scenarios.I don\u2019t think that is going to happen. We are a smart species. Instead of robots ruling over us, I think, we will be cyborgs. And, that is not a frightening situation to me. We are, to an extent, cyborgs already, because of the smartphones we use. Let us take Stephen Hawking\u2019s case. With ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), how was he able to communicate? The computer would generate speech through the twitching of muscles in his cheek. He was using the first generation brain-computer interface. In another three to four years, we will have nanobots within us. I think this might happen. I was recently invited to Blue Origin (a privately funded aerospace manufacturer founded by Jeff Bezos). I sat in their New Shepard spacecraft. Billions of dollars are spent on outer-space exploration. We are running out of resources on this planet. As our civilisation advances, our energy needs grows. We will run out of resources in the next 40 to 50 years. We might go to Mars or we will create colonies in outer space closer to Earth. But we also need to protect this planet. Astronauts, who have gone out of this planet, across geographies and decades have one thing in common: they return with much more appreciation and love for Earth.It can\u2026 but I am an optimist. I believe, as a civilisation, we are maturing. There has been much less war and conflict now than during any time in the past. There is so much out there today. We are talking about going to Mars. So, I don\u2019t see a large-scale conflict arising soon. Well, yes and no. Time is relative. Time on the moon, Earth and Mars are all different. People would age differently. So, time travel won\u2019t happen in the way where I can go back and meet my grandfather. But we might overcome certain speed barriers. And, perhaps we will be able to discover new dimensions. We have limitations on our visual and audio spectrum. With technology\u2019s help we\u2019d be able to overcome them as well. And, it\u2019s already happening \u2014 we can now see far greater distances than our vision allows, we can hear a bat\u2019s signal.I am sure humans are becoming immortal. We will either genetically modify ourselves or use implants that modify our capabilities. Gene modifying technologies are at the application level already, not even at the testing stage. But our policies, ethics and politics might not be ready for it yet. We keep making stuff but we don\u2019t know how to deal with them. We are totally unprepared for the changes.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\n\nWhat are CryptoKitties?\n\n",
      "Updated: June 24, 2019 17:02 IST\rPublished: June 24, 2019 17:02 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microchips-cryptokitties-collectibles-cryptocurrency/article28125335.ece",
      "When CryptoKitties, founded by Bryce Blandon, made its way into crypto-economics, anyone with a keen eye on blockchain had a remarkable reaction on the spectrum. The game requires users to trade and breed virtual kittens between the established store and other users on the Ethereum blockchain. The chain\u2019s valuable digital coin, ether, is loaded on a virtual wallet for use in-game. Technically known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), these virtual items keep changing in value over time. This is determined by a barrage of factors, but follows a pattern similar to age-old collectible card games like Pok\u00e9mon and baseball cards. Such cards currently sell for a generous premium, resembling the structure that CryptoKitties follow. After all, cryptographically unique collectibles open up the doors for an entirely new kind of digital asset. And what tends to make things go viral? Cute animals, of course. But it\u2019s a real thing, and much like other crypto-entities, they have a report with official information and proposals too. Instead of calling it a white paper, the team quirkily calls it a \u2018White Pa-purr.\u2019That said, the official website clarifies that CryptoKitties are not currency, but rather crypto-collectibles. The value of a feline is determined by the supply and demand for that breed. If demand is substantial, it can be auctioned to other players for a profit. The digital kittens are available from under a dollar to upwards of six figures. There is a processing fee to the trade, which is best explained by the Gas and Fees guide available on the CryptoKitties webpage, which states, \u201cWhenever you buy, breed, and create or cancel an auction, your request gets sent to miners on the Ethereum network who crunch the numbers and confirm the transaction... For that service, the miners receive a network fee paid by the person submitting the transaction request. That fee is determined by two factors: the \u2018Gas Price\u2019 of your transaction and the amount of gas used to process it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nThe various CryptoKitties as shown on the official website \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s a market wall: \u201c\u2018Gas Limit\u2019 sets the maximum amount of computational power you\u2019ll allow the miner to use before they top out and stop processing your request.\u201d \u2018CryptoKitties: A case study\u2019 by Julia M Sufrin from the University of Texas at the Austin School of Information, however, pegs the surge in participation to a clog in the Ethereum network, which caused transactional issues in the system. The co-founder of Blocumen Studios and Blockchained India, Manav Ailawadi, adds that \u201cit would be a good thing to explore\u201d and understand the workings of a game on the platform. (However, it was difficult to find a contact who was willing to discuss the intricacies of NFTs, as most serious blockchain users only deal with currency investments like Bitcoin, Dash and Ripple.) So where does CryptoKitties stand? Julia observes, \u201cThere are now, of course, other kinds of crypto-collectibles on the market, though each lacks the powerful network effect that CryptoKitties has developed,\u201d but also notes there are some problems worth second and third looks \u2014 the primary being resistance by crypto-enthusiasts..Despite these issues, we bet these adorable digi-cats aren\u2019t close to giving up.Byte-sized play-by-plays of tech conceptsYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHow Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are upgrading the food and dining scene \n",
      "Updated: June 24, 2019 16:52 IST\rPublished: June 24, 2019 16:52 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/converging-taste-with-tech-virtual-realty-and-augmented-reality/article28125263.ece",
      "\nVR and AR to the fore at SubliMotion in Ibiza, Spain \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSubliMotion  Dining at SubliMotion is said to be a mind-blowing multi-sensory experience. Touted to be the most expensive restaurant, SubliMotion in Ibiza, Spain, is the brainchild of 2-Michelin-star chef Paco Roncero. A typical meal at SubliMotion is 20 courses long, lasts three hours and costs upwards of $2,000 per person. Diners experience everything from a video intro that diners describe as akin to time-travelling amid 360-degree projections. Sounds like something out of The Jetsons.SubliMotion, to put it succinctly, is the perfect example of how technology, on so many levels, has pervaded the food industry. In fact, the very vernacular around dining has evolved because of it; at these establishments, you are no longer considered a mere \u2018diner\u2019, but a consumer, as you\u2019re immersed in these experiences.Don\u2019t worry though, you don\u2019t need to break the bank to experience the magical duet of technology and food.Closer home, you have Loft, a Zee5 Experience, with its host of caf\u00e9s across multiple Indian cities, and its proud use of gadgetry to pull in diners. They have everything from Xbox and PlayStation consoles to a smoothie cycle (you\u2019ve got to pedal the cycle to power the blender that makes your smoothie) to keep diners engaged. These are ways to engage consumers in more ways than one, points out Ali Zaidi, business head at Loft. He continues, \u201cWith the consumer attention span getting leaner by the day, it becomes very important to keep them occupied. One of the most effective ways for us to introduce this novel experience in our caf\u00e9s was through the infusion of technology and games into our offerings.\u201d Loft also conducts game nights at an outlet level and hosts a gamut of workshops and events.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoothie-cycle at Zee5 Loft Experience \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile tablets and iPods might not generate much interest, there are restaurant owners who\u2019re upping the ante with interactive tables. Mumbai-based Drinx Exchange\u2019s interactive tables allow diners to tap the table for everything from cricket scores to paying the bill. The screen also gives them offers on drinks available at the bar. At Chennai\u2019s Robot restaurant, robots have replaced waiters, as the droids move around the restaurants speaking to diners and carrying trays of food to respective tables. At Robo Kitchen in Hyderabad, robots simply deliver your food while waiters take your order.The Beer Caf\u00e9, which has branches across multiple Indian cities, has been using technology for quite some time now to keep their diners engaged. With Brew Miles that diners can rack up on their app, to URBAR which allows them to access a virtual bar, the caf\u00e9 has been playing the technology game right. Diners can pay ahead for a set amount of their favourite beverages and use the app to scan the QR code at any Beer Caf\u00e9 to get served.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Beer Caf\u00e9 in Saket \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nTechnology has been making its presence felt even at franchised and budget restaurants, with simple things like tablet devices and iPods being used for everything from browsing menus, to taking orders and feedback. Then there\u2019s Dash, a tool that lets diners taste, or rather experience, the food even before they\u2019ve ordered it at a restaurant. Sounds impossible. Monica Narula, who headed food programming at NDTV for several years and the brain behind Dash, says that the idea to create 15-second videos (or \u2018fideos\u2019) of dishes being served at restaurants came about when, \u201cpeople expected me to know everything about every dish just because I was into food programming\u201d. That\u2019s when she along with two other colleagues, Gunjan Mehrish and Noopur Tiwari decided to create \u201ctrailers of food offered at restaurants.\u201d\u201cThese videos take them through the complexities of creating a dish, the flavours and textures one can expect, and also throws in trivia related to the food. It works as food porn,\u201d says Monica, \u201cIn that sense, Dash is not an app, it\u2019s an appetiser.\u201d In the three years since its launch, Dash is now being used by over 40 brands, including Taj, Marriott, ITC, Mamagoto and Dhaba.An interesting trivia? Dash as an idea impressed Ratan Tata so much that he became a seed investor in the company.Printer\u2019s got your foodIn the last few years, 3D printing has really taken off in the food industry. There have been several reports of even NASA 3D printing food (where the \u2018D\u2019 stands for \u2018dining\u2019) including a pizza. While this might seem like it is straight out of a sci-fi movie, edible 3D printing is becoming more popular with both the food industry and consumers. Most food 3D printers use extrusion technology that engages paste-type ingredients. Some of the most commonly printed foods are chocolate, pancakes and pizzas.Along similar lines, but making use of Augmented Reality (AR) is Yeppar. Launched in 2016, the company began designing menus using AR for restaurants across the country. Today, with over 200 restaurants on board across India, Lisbon, Shanghai and UAE, Yeppar provides diners a realistic image of what their food will be like. \u201cWe\u2019re all about integrating AR in experiential marketing. Our AR menus help people visualise what a dish will look like at a restaurant,\u201d says Ankush Sharma, CEO of Yeppar. \u201cOften, you read about a dish on the menu, but despite the description, what one gets might be very different from what one expects. Since you can\u2019t really return food once ordered, it helps to be able to visualise it before you order. Yeppar provides diners a 3D image of the food, ingredients, nutritional value and also what to pair it with to help them arrive at a decision.\u201dAnkush believes that one of the biggest challenges faced by retail these days is not the quality of products, but how to best engage customers. \u201cTechnology excites people and can offer a lot of gimmicks. Earlier restaurants would have live ghazals; that might be pass\u00e9 now. But given the technology-driven world we live in, it is the perfect way to provide people with a wholesome experience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe successfully-tested drones for food pick-up by Zomato\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nThen there are the drones. In December last year, Zomato acquired TechEagle, a Lucknow-based drone startup, to help it create a \u201chub-to-hub delivery network powered by hybrid multi-motor drones\u201d. A couple of weeks ago, they also successfully tested this technology. The drone could cover a distance of five kilometres at a speed of 80 kilometres per hours with a payload of five kilograms. The test was carried out as per DGCA norms. The drone has inbuilt sensors and an onboard computer to sense and avoid hurdles. It is also capable of taking off vertically like a helicopter.If all goes well, the next time you order food, you\u2019ll have a drone hovering outside your door.

      "\nKhushbu Sundar\n\u00a0 A day after actor-turned-politician Kushboo complained on her Twitter handle about a container lorry parked in the corner of her street, the Chennai City traffic police swung into action and impounded the vehicle. On June 22, Ms. Kushboo tweeted along with pictures: \u201cthis container has been parked at the corner of our street for the last 10 days, not even a single citizen around that has even bothered to check or complain.. it raises suspicion as it doesn\u2019t even have a number plate.

On Sunday, the police replied that the vehicle was impounded and requested her to download the GCTP citizen services app. \u201cI appreciate their prompt response. It was at the end of my street. You cannot turn a blind eye to such a thing,\u201d she said.The traffic police took to Twitter in June 2017 and have over 9,500 followers. However, it is only recently that they started taking action on complaints raised on the social media platform. Over the past month, a total of 500 complaints were tweeted. \u201cWe can take action only after verifying the complaint through CCTV footage.

      "Updated: June 23, 2019 13:06 IST\rPublished: June 23, 2019 00:02 IST",

      "\nTWO SIDES: \u201cLibra may have a few things working in its favour. But going by the opposition to the idea, it is not going to be smooth sailing.\u201d Representations of virtual currency in front of the Libra logo \u00a0 | Photo Credit: DADO RUVIC The story so far: On June 18, Facebook announced that it is going to launch a global digital currency by the first half of 2020. The currency has been named Libra. It will be run by the Libra Association, a Geneva-based entity that has over two dozen founding partners, including Facebook, Mastercard, Visa, Uber and the Vodafone group. Almost immediately, concerns were raised by some lawmakers, commentators and even the co-founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who is now one of the foremost critics of the social media network he helped create.A white paper released by the Libra Association says its mission \u201cis to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people\u201d. The point it makes is this: in a world with cheap data and smartphones, about 1.7 billion adults are still outside the organised financial system in the world. This, despite a billion of them having mobile phones and nearly half a billion having Internet access.The reasons for this are high fees, lack of access, and absence of documentation. Libra is being pitched as a solution to this. The promise is of financial inclusion on a global scale.The white paper says: \u201cMoving money around globally should be as easy and cost-effective as \u2014 and even more safe and secure than \u2014 sending a text message or sharing a photo, no matter where you live, what you do, or how much you earn.\u201d It is true that Bitcoin and Libra are both based on block chain technology, which refers to a form of distributed ledger \u2014 not centralised \u2014 of transactions. These are created by complicated math functions that make them almost incorruptible. But beyond this, there is very little in common between Bitcoin and Libra.Libra is an initiative of 28 influential corporate entities. Bitcoin, which the world first came to know of in 2008, is seen as a product of libertarian values. Its founder, whose identity remains a mystery to this day, is referred to as Satoshi Nakamoto.In Bitcoin: The Future of Money?, Dominic Frisby imagines what would happen if Bitcoin becomes somehow globally preferred: \u201cIn a flash, the ability for a government to fund itself through the manipulation of money disappears. You can\u2019t obfuscate bitcoin supply \u2014 inflation is transparent. You can\u2019t \u2018quantitatively ease\u2019 bitcoins... Central banks and private banks can\u2019t create bitcoins when it suits them, and government can\u2019t print bitcoins. It all means you don\u2019t have to pay the price for the mistakes of governments and banks.\u201dLibra is going to be nothing like Bitcoin. The association white paper says, \u201cWe believe that collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure that a sustainable, secure and trusted framework underpins this new system.\u201dThose are just some of the differences. Bitcoin, though built on a sound technological base, has had to encounter challenges relating to regulation across the world. Governments of the world, including India, have been wary of it functioning outside the ambit of organised finance. With huge swings in value, it remains one of the most volatile currencies.Libra immediately has a few things working in its favour. A currency, to be a success, needs to have acceptability amongst many people. Facebook, with its over 2 billion users, and its partners could tick this box. Also, the Libra Association is promising to play by the regulatory rule book.Plus, to make it a relative stable currency, not prone to wild fluctuations, the creators of Libra are backing this up with a reserve of real assets. Still, going by the opposition to the idea, it isn\u2019t going to be a smooth sail for Libra.Bloomberg has reported that the French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called on the Group of Seven central bank governors to \u201cprepare a report on Facebook\u2019s project for their July meeting. His concerns include privacy, money laundering and terrorism finance\u201d. Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, has also been reported as saying that Facebook could become a \u201cshadow bank\u201d and that regulators should be on high alert.Facebook\u2019s co-founder Hughes, terming the digital currency \u201cfrightening\u201d, has said it is a shift of power from central banks towards multinational corporations.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/google-doodle-celebrates-the-87th-birth-anniversary-of-amrish-puri/article28106917.ece",
      "Today\u2019s Google doodle, designed by Pune-based artist Debangshu Moulik, celebrates the 87th birth anniversary of noted Bollywood actor Amrish Puri. For the design, Mr. Moulik took inspiration from old hand-painted Bollywood movie posters and the streets of India.Amrish Puri, born on June 22, 1932, is best remembered for the iconic villains he played in Hindi cinema, from Mogambo in Shekhar Kapur\u2019s Mr. India to Thakur Durjan Singh in Karan Arjun. In Hollywood, he played Mola Ram in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Khan in Richard Attenborough\u2019s Gandhi . He had acted in over 400 films in Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, English, Punjabi, Malayalam, Telugu and Tamil, before his death in 2005.He won three Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actor. He was also a prominent stage actor and acted in Mumbai\u2019s Prithvi Theatre in a multitude of roles in plays by the likes of Satyadev Dubey and the recently deceased Girish Karnad. He won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1979. In fact, his theatre roles earned him television ads and eventually, films, at the age of 40.Puri left a lasting impression with his villainous roles through the 1980s and 1990s. His distinguished look and deep baritone made him suitable for a wide range of negative roles, from the absolutely villainous Mogambo to the stringent father Chaudhry Baldev Singh in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. His bloodshot eyes and reverberating laughter could evoke a multitude of emotions in his audience- mostly fear, disgust or loathing- as he went about being tyrannical. His first role was in the film Prem Pujari, released in 1970.Iconic Hollywood director Steven Spielberg described him as \u201c the best (villain) the world has ever produced and ever will\u201d. In his personal life, Puri was quite the contrary. He is remembered by his friends and colleagues as a gentle and sensitive person, who would often mentor young actors off-screen.When Puri came to Mumbai, with less than a hundred rupees in his pocket, his elder brothers Madan Puri and Chaman Puri were already successful actors in negative roles. Puri, however, failed his first screen test in 1954 and went on to find a job with the Employees' State Insurance Corporation. His work in theatre allowed him to meet Bollywood director Shyam Benegal. Puri began as a voiceover artist for an actor in one of Mr. Benegal\u2019s films, after which he starred in almost every movie made by the director. Eventually, a strong friendship developed between the two and Puri earned wide accolade for his roles in Nishant and Bhumika. Mr. Benegal remembers Puri as having had \u201cextremely disciplined ways\u201d.Amrish Puri passed away on January 12, 2005. He was suffering from blood cancer."

      "\nFacebook\u2019s plan plan to create a digital currency used across the world is already raising concern with financial regulators and privacy experts. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  A leading U.S. House lawmaker on Tuesday called on Facebook Inc. to halt the development on its new cryptocurrency and its company executives to testify before Congress, adding to global concerns about what the digital currency could mean for data privacy and security.Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said that Facebook should halt development of the product, dubbed Libra, until Congress and regulators can review the issue, and called on company executives to testify before Congress.\u201cFacebook has data on billions of people and has repeatedly shown a disregard for the protection and careful use of this data. With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users,\u201d she said in a statement.Her comments came after Representative Patrick McHenry, the senior Republican on her panel, also sought a hearing on Facebook's new initiative. A Facebook representative said that the company looked forward to answering the lawmakers' questions.Facebook's announcement was met with immediate backlash from U.S. lawmakers and regulators across the globe, who are concerned that Facebook is already too massive and careless with users' privacy.\u201cFacebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users data without protecting their privacy. We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, in a statement.U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who also sits on Senate Banking Committee, expressed concern that through Libra, Facebook was using its scale in social networking to achieve dominance in adjacent markets like mobile payments.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called for more regulation of tech companies. \u201cThis instrument for transactions will allow Facebook to collect millions and millions of data, which strengthens my conviction that there is a need to regulate the digital giants,\u201d he said in an interview on Europe 1 radio.But Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said he had an open mind on the potential utility of the product, while warning that it could face strict regulation.Facebook has engaged with regulators in the United States and abroad about the planned cryptocurrency, company executives said. They would not specify which regulators.A U.S. regulatory source briefed on the matter said that Facebook had been in communication with U.S. regulators but it was still unclear how the currency would be structured and whether it would directly fall under any existing U.S. regulatory regimes.Switzerland's financial watchdog said that it was in contact with the initiators of the Libra project but declined to comment on whether it was obtaining specific regulatory permission or status.Markus Ferber, a senior German lawmaker in the European parliament, said in a statement that Facebook's new coin should put regulators on high alert and called on the European Commission to start work on regulatory framework for virtual currencies.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nWho upgraded my Tamagotchi?: Japan\u2019s favourite toy is all set for an update after 22 years\n\n",
      "Updated: June 18, 2019 14:34 IST\rPublished: June 18, 2019 14:34 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/who-upgraded-my-tamagotchi-japans-favourite-toy-is-all-set-for-an-update-after-22-years/article28054116.ece",
      "Ostensibly designed to teach children about caring for pets minus the mess of having a real one, Tamagotchi (from the Japanese \u2018tamago\u2019 for egg and \u2018uotchi\u2019 for watch) snowballed into what we could now call a \u2018viral hit\u2019. Such was the market frenzy in the mid-1990s that manufacturer Bandai reportedly sold nearly 40 million units worldwide. That said, it\u2019s safe to say that nearly every pocket in the 90s had a Tamagotchi nested in there, either waiting for its next, um, snack, or just taking a nap. At its peak, 15 Tamagotchi units were sold every minute in the United States and Canada. Bandai had to conduct lotteries to pick customers after supplies ran short in 1997, and for a brief while, Tamagotchi was banned in American and Japanese schools over concerns that players were getting too addicted and black marketers were cashing in on the craze.The gadget goes socialHave a browse through social media and you\u2019ll find a flurry of emotional posts.Tumblr: Pegged as the \u2018emo corner of the Internet,\u2019 Tumblr offers up a different \u2014 but oh so real \u2014 love for these devices.Reddit: The \u2018front page of the Internet\u2019 has an official thread titled r/tamagotchi. The thread is a forum-rich exchange for the more hardcore fans with the occasional novice question such as ones around battery life and ageing, or even, bizarrely, genetics.The vintage monochromatic Tamagotchi, where the hungry and emotionally needy pet had to be fed, cleaned and rested, (failing which the critter would \u2018die\u2019) is a far cry from the more sophisticated electronic toys in the market today. And while it has never really gone out of production, Tamagotchi\u2019s newest avatar is aimed at both nostalgic adult players and a new generation of users.Tamagotchi On has features that allow players to create their own collection of toys and wares. They have a quirky origin story too, given they are digital creatures from a faraway planet. Players raise them from egg to maturity with the help of the three untagged navigator buttons on the front panel. Beeps will keep reminding users to check on the characters from time to time.Tamagotchi On\u2019s new characters can travel, have play dates with other creatures, fall in love and even get married (huh?). You also get to create a \u2018dynasty\u2019 after the pets, well, procreate.While the older version was designed to fit on a keychain, Tamagotchi On is chunkier, measuring 2.5 inches with a 2.25-inch LCD colour screen and an infra-red sensor. The new version is smartphone-friendly, with a Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) model that allows creatures to be transferred to an upcoming Tamagotchi app, thus enabling multi-player events and downloads.But it doesn\u2019t need Wi-Fi to work. There are some upgraded add-ons like \u2018Gotchi points\u2019 to keep the pet rested in a Tama hotel (and the device from beeping) while the caretaker is unable to respond for long periods.The bells and whistles need some serious battery juice and early online product reviews say Tamagotchi On uses up two AAA cells in four to five days of continuous play. Bandai is hoping that the retro appeal of the toy will justify the purported $60 (\u20b94,200) price of Tamagotchi On.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\n#MyTikTokStory: How TikTok is following YouTube\u2019s steps in advertising \n",
      "Updated: June 18, 2019 15:06 IST\rPublished: June 18, 2019 14:33 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/mytiktokstory-how-tiktok-is-following-youtubes-steps-in-advertising/article28053964.ece",
      "Foray into the TikTok app and you are likely to fall down a rabbit hole of popular 15- to 60-second videos \u2014 from dance and comedic clips to users lip-syncing songs and movie dialogues. It\u2019s an extremely addictive exercise. A quick scroll through the seemingly endless stream of suggestions, and you are, for days, likely to retain the earworm of a song that you\u2019ve just heard for 15 seconds.Owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, the app was merged with the similar Musical.ly (remember this addictive entity?) and rebranded as TikTok last year. According to TikTok, the app has amassed over 200 million users in India, and 120 million of them flock to the platform every month as active users. We\u2019ve spoken about the app\u2019s three-week strike-down from app stores in April and the legalese, after the Madras High Court voiced concerns that it exposed children to pornographic and inappropriate content. But the app witnessed a surge of users and its campaign, #ReturnOfTikTok, currently has over three billion views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Yes, the platform has had a bumpier ride. Earlier this year, the USA\u2019s Federal Trade Commission slammed a record fine \u2014 of $5.7 million \u2014 on the app, for illegally collecting personal data of users who were children. TikTok agreed to increase privacy protections then, and now seems to be focused on tidying up its image.And in doing so, it looks like the app is following YouTube\u2019s blueprint. Following a Creator\u2019s Lab in Tokyo in February, TikTok hosted over 500 of its stars from around the country at a Creator\u2019s Lab in Mumbai recently. Over the past decade, YouTube has turned its attention to similar labs, \u2018summits\u2019 and even studios \u2014 to bring creators together on collaborations and an exchange of ideas, while also equipping them with resources to improve the quality of their content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0By launching #MyTikTokStory last week, TikTok is encouraging creators to showcase their talents on the platform \u2014 from DIYs to singing. Some influencers use the hashtag to share what the platform has meant to them. The aim appears to be to readjust the image of the app from a platform for lip-syncing videos to one with more individual and diverse content that creators can bring. So like with Instagram, will there be a generation of TikTok influencers?In churning out campaigns and focusing on increasing engagement on the platform, TikTok is looking to bring together advertisers and creators \u2014 much like YouTube\u2019s model. So far, brands including Myntra, Pepsi, Snapdeal and Shaadi.com have advertised on the platform after recognising its reach.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nA Pakistani fan video that tickles all alike post Indo-Pak match \n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/a-pakistani-fan-video-that-tickles-all-alike-post-indo-pak-match/article28051196.ece",
      "One of the biggest takeaways of the India-Pakistan CWC 2019 match on Sunday was the show of self-deprecating humour by Pakistani fans, manifesting most prominently in their sporting tweets in the face of defeat. The blockbuster of the day, however, was 23-year-old London-based Lahore boy Momin Saqib\u2019s \u201cburger-pizzzey-Hico ice cream\u201d gig about a Pakistani fan\u2019s pain and frustration at the abominable fitness levels of the team. The hyper melodramatic-comic tone and the relatable \u201cPunjabiness\u201d of the act made it go viral on social media in India as well, and it is still regaling many online. \u201cPeople are happily sharing the video and editing clips into other relevant memes as well,\u201d Momin told The Hindu in an email exchange.Shot outside Old Trafford Manchester, the meltdown of the Pakistani fan is set up like a spontaneous interview. While Momin vents on about the betrayal by captain Sarfaraz Ahmed and how the world came crashing down at the score of 119, his elder brother, Bilal bin Saqib, wipes his simulated tears with the country\u2019s flag. \u201cEverything that happened [in the video] was spur-of-the-moment and totally impromptu,\u201d says Momin. \n\nAwwTHE LEGEND MOMIN SAQIB #CWC19 #INDvPAK pic.twitter.com/QfCwXA8aCo\u2014 Squirrel_Of_R\u0251m (@Squirrel_Soul) June 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0AwwTHE LEGEND MOMIN SAQIB #CWC19 #INDvPAK pic.twitter.com/QfCwXA8aCoMomin\u2019s cricket videos have been popular in Pakistan for a while but this one worked both sides of the border. People in Pakistan have been able to relate to it due to the shared disappointment and displeasure that he expressed, whereas, in India, it is the humour that has attracted the audience.The fun has come as a refreshing relief in the \u201cwar zones\u201d that India Pakistan cricket matches seem to have become of late. Momin thinks that cricketing rivalry is equally prevalent in India and Pakistan and both the nations know that winning and losing is part of the game. \u201cSince the emergence of social media\u2019s meme trend, we have been able to handle defeat with humour for quite a long time now and that beautifies the game itself,\u201d he says.\n\n\ndollar ka rate aur India k runs control karna hamare bas ki baat nahi\u2014 Shiraz Hassan (@ShirazHassan) June 16, 2019\n\nWe might be winning the match but Pakistanis totally won on Twitter today!! \u2014 Sunanda (@YoursLegallyy) June 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0dollar ka rate aur India k runs control karna hamare bas ki baat nahiWe might be winning the match but Pakistanis totally won on Twitter today!! While congratulating India for a wonderful performance, Momin admits being disappointed by the Sunday loss but isn\u2019t ready to give up his optimism: \u201cFailure and defeat can bring you big wins if you learn from them constructively. My comments were only pun-intended and I am hoping that our Pakistani team is going to power up for the upcoming matches and will leave no stone unturned in making us proud, just as they have been doing in the past.\u201dMomin, who believes in living in the moment, has a very loyal network of followers on social media \u2014 Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat \u2014 which he calls his \u201conline family\u201d and who he helps in adopting a positive mindset through his daily feed. \u201cI have always tried to cheer people up in times of stress and challenges on a daily basis\u2026 most of us get too involved in the idea of being defeated by adverse moments while knowing nothing is in our control except our own mindset and attitude,\u201d he says.Comedy is not all there is to Momin. In fact he doesn\u2019t like to consider himself a stand-up comedian. He recently completed Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science and Management from King\u2019s College London and hopes to work in the education sector. In 2017, he became the first non-European student to serve as the President of the King\u2019s College London Students\u2019 Union in its 144 years, representing 32,000 students locally, nationally and internationally.He has been a motivational speaker, has given a Ted Talk at the King\u2019s College London, elaborating on his journey from Pakistan to London and his foray into student politics. He has been actively involved in the promotion of youth engagement in social and political issues and in mentoring students.During his time at King\u2019s he was part of many initiatives to promote peace between India and Pakistan. \u201cOne example is the development of the King\u2019s College London Indo-Pak development forum where I hosted its first event on women empowerment with speakers from India and Pakistan,\u201d he says.His brother Bilal, who he considers his greatest support and who is always part of his videos, is the current postgraduate president at the London School of Economics representing 7,000 students. Momin and Bilal are co-founders of Tayaba, a non-profit organisation that aims to provide ease in accessing clean water in rural Pakistan. \u201cIt has transformed the lives of over 30,000 women and children in rural Sindh,\u201d claims Momin.A Bollywood fan, who actually wanted to do a degree in method acting after his A-Levels, Momin has made many Indian friends during his London stint and is looking forward to visiting India in the future.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "We have sweated into it profusely, thrown it around on grass and gravel, pushed it rudely into bags of different types, and the Ant Audio Wave Sports 450 Neckband Earphone has gone along, with nary a protest.The UK brand that entered India towards the end of last year, specialises in audio tech and does earphone, speakers, and sound bars. We tested the wireless earphones (with mic) across four months, with two people (my son and I) using it, mostly running with it, but also sometimes dozing onto it on a cool, hard floor (because running in Delhi\u2019s 45-degree heat is not easy). It has seen careless-teenager and busy-mother treatment and has stayed strong.It has a battery that lasts and lasts (upto 10 hours), is splash-proof (you can\u2019t dunk it in water), is comfortable around the neck with its soft neckband (it\u2019s not a tangled mess when you take it out), and has magnets on the tips of the earplugs for easy storage. Once you connect to your phone or watch, it reconnects without a glitch.The best part is the design of the plugs. Little silicone extensions \u2018hook\u2019 into the crook of the ear, holding them in place, unlike most other earphones that end up falling out. You also put them into the ear intuitively, and don\u2019t need to look for the R sign.I\u2019m not sure what the magnets, Bluetooth and all the germs from the running together do to your health, but just as earphones go, I\u2019d buy them again. Perhaps earphone companies should include cleaning kits for sports models. They have thoughtfully given an e-waste disposal link on the pack, too! The only problem?

      "\n\nAll you need to know about the ban on Huawei in USA \n",

      "\nA representative illustration of US President Donald Trump and Huawei \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nDeepak Harichandan  Given they\u2019re a fast-growing smartphone and laptop brand, China-based Huawei is practically synonymous with up-and-coming tech brands, especially with Scarlett Johanssen and Henry Cavill posing stylishly with devices we\u2019re so sure they\u2019re using. The tech company is also pioneering in 5G telecom equipment after spending on research for the good part of two decades.Developments took a surprising detour when, in May, US President Donald Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to restrict trade with China because it feels using their telecom technologies could pose risks to US\u2019 national security. It\u2019s a move which took the tech world aback, not just the US and China.As a result, all US-based companies have cold-shouldered Huawei Technologies \u2014 but this hasn\u2019t put Huawei on the back foot... in fact, they are using social media to respond to the accusations by the US.On May 24, Amazon pulled out Huawei devices in Japan from its website. However, no such steps have been taken in India. Banning sales in India which is one the largest smartphone market would definitely heat up the US-China trade-war. As per GSMA report \u2018India: becoming 5G-ready\u2019 in May 2019, a growing number of trails have taken place with various vendors including Huawei and Ericsson. Recent reports suggest that India is yet to give the nod to Huawei\u2019s 5G trial participation due to security concerns.Mumbai-based techie Munaf Kapadia says, \u201cWhether the bans stay or not, I feel this experience will push Huawei to be a self-reliant company which will lead to more innovations.\u201dConsidering the impact of ban of their business, Huawei has been careful with its response. Last month, Catherine Chen, a Director of the Board at Huawei wrote \u2018The US is a shining example of how to inspire passion for technological innovation and development. We too have been inspired by your history of creativity and hard work. I am writing to you in the hopes that we can come to understand each other better.\u2019 How smooth is that?Mishaal Rahman, editor-in-chief at XDA Developers, a developers portal, points out, \u201cThey\u2019re employing a rather clever strategy to fight back against the perception that the US government wants to levy on Huawei: that it\u2019s a security threat and de facto arm of the Chinese government. Huawei is taking advantage of the fact that the U.S. government almost certainly cannot publicize whatever evidence it has - if it indeed has any - against the company.\u201dOn the other hand, they have upped the ante on Twitter. They have been responding to reports from US media from a Twitter account @HuaweiFacts. This account was created in January 2016, how impressive is their hindsight? Until 2019, it had less than 300 tweets.\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, since the ban, the activity has catapulted significantly. Twitteratis from both camps are letting their voice heard. After all, all publicity is good publicity right? Mishaal adds, \u201cIn this age of mistrust in the government and \u2018fake news\u2019, Huawei isn\u2019t standing down in the face of allegations. Accounts like @HuaweiFacts show how they\u2019re challenging the U.S. to put forward evidence or drop the accusations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think that\u2019s cheeky wait till you hear this \u2014 Hong Kong-based meme sharing site 9GAG has a dedicated tab for the Huawei memes on their front page. Whether this was engineered by Huawei or not, it will surely help them stay relevant in the market. For now, it seems like Huawei is dealing with the situation well.

      "\nThe Mark Zuckerberg-led social network giant is expected to outline details of a virtual currency launching next year.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Facebook is set to unveil a bid to bring cryptocurrency payments into the mainstream, reportedly with the endorsement of governments and financial giants.The world's biggest social network is expected to outline details of a virtual currency launching next year that it hopes will avoid the rollercoaster volatility of \u201cblockchain\u201d technologies such as bitcoin. Facebook is setting up a consortium called \u201cLibra\u201d which, according to the Wall Street Journal, has been joined by more than a dozen companies including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber.The companies along with venture capitalists and telecommunications firms will reportedly invest around $10 million each into the consortium.Facebook has been trying to ward off hostile regulatory scrutiny after a series of privacy abuses and the spread of fake news.The consortium will be managed externally and will seek to build trust among consumers by pegging the virtual coin to a basket of currencies including the dollar and euro, the Journal said.Facebook has already sought blessings from the US Treasury and the Bank of England, the BBC reported last month.Regulators have been reticent about cryptocurrencies, not only due to potential abuse by criminals but the wild swings in their value harming consumers.With more than two billion users across its platforms, which include WhatsApp and Instagram, Facebook could have the clout to bring cryptocurrency out of the fringes and emulate the likes of WeChat in China, where the US site is banned.WeChat allows its users to chat, shop and play games without leaving its platform, generating more revenue by offering a one-stop portal. Buffeted by the privacy storms, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has promised a new direction for Facebook built around smaller groups, private messaging and payments.But it will need to overcome questions of trust and privacy, not least over how financial data will be stored. Some analysts are betting that the heavyweight Libra consortium will help to do that.Facebook's crypto initiative could facilitate shopping, applications and gaming, and would leverage its broad user base in Asia, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note last week.It \u201cmay prove to be one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company to unlock new engagement and revenue streams\u201d, he wrote.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRepresentation of the Bitcoin virtual currency standing on a PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n  The use of Bitcoin \u2014 a popular virtual currency \u2014 emits over 22 megatonnes of carbon dioxide annually, comparable to the total emissions of cities such as Las Vegas and Vienna, a study has found. Researchers from Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany carried out a detailed calculation of the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin system.  For a Bitcoin transfer to be executed and validated, a mathematical puzzle must be solved by an arbitrary computer in the global Bitcoin network.The network, which anyone can join, rewards the puzzle solvers in Bitcoin. The computing capacity used in this process \u2014 known as Bitcoin mining \u2014 has increased rapidly in recent years. Statistics show that it quadrupled in 2018 alone. Consequently, the Bitcoin boom raises the question of whether the cryptocurrency is imposing an additional burden on the climate. Several studies have attempted to quantify the CO2 emissions caused by Bitcoin mining. \u201cThese studies are based on a number of approximations, however,\u201d said Christian Stoll, who conducts the research at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The team began by calculating the power consumption of the network. This depends primarily on the hardware used for Bitcoin mining. The researchers determined the annual electricity consumption by Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be about 46 TWh.  Live tracking data from the mining pools provided the decisive information on how much energy is emitted by carbon dioxide is emitted with the use of this energy. The IP addresses in the statistics published by the two biggest pools showed that miners tend to join pools in or near their home countries. Based on these data, the team was able to localise 68% of the Bitcoin network computing power in Asian countries, 17% in European countries, and 15% in North America. The researchers also cross-checked this conclusion against the results of another method by localising the IP addresses of individual miners using an internet of things search engine. They then combined their results with statistics on the carbon intensity of power generation in the various countries. The Bitcoin system has a carbon footprint of between 22 and 22.9 megatonnes per year. That is comparable to the footprint of such cities as Hamburg, Vienna or Las Vegas.\u201cNaturally there are bigger factors contributing to climate change. However, the carbon footprint is big enough to make it worth discussing the possibility of regulating cryptocurrency mining in regions where power generation is especially carbon-intensive,\u201d said Stoll. \u201cTo improve the ecological balance, one possibility might be to link more mining farms to additional renewable generating capacity,\u201d he said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA young girl looking at a model of Giant Metrowave Radio Telescope. File\n\u00a0  The city-based National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) is all set to host the five-day annual International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) meet from June 17 to 21. The meet is a collaboration of radio astronomers from a dozen countries across the globe.\u201cIndia has been an associate member of the IPTA since the last four years. But this is the first time that we will be hosting the annual meeting,\u201d Dr. J.K.Solanki, head of administration, NCRA, said.The IPTA is a collaboration of radio astronomers from a dozen countries across the globe. It uses more than 12 radio telescopes all over the world with an aim to detect ultra-low frequency gravitational waves. More than 40 expert international astronomers and 30 international students are expected to participate in the event, besides several Indian participants.\u201cThe upgrade of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune and the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) has helped us meet the parameters for being a full member of the IPTA. We hope to achieve this status by the conclusion of the upcoming meeting. We are expecting eighty international members apart from the twenty persons who will be representing our country,\u201d informed Dr. Solanki. The current status of the quest for ultra-low frequency Gravitational Waves and the roadmap for future technical and scientific challenges is to be the main focus of the meeting.\u201cThese waves are wrinkles in space-time produced by two massive black holes, each revolving around the other. Such black holes, which weigh billion times more than our Sun, are found in the centres of colliding galaxies. These waves affect radio pulses from 10km size stars called radio pulsars by changing ever so slightly the period of radio pulsation of these stars,\u201d said Prof. Yashwant Gupta, centre director, NCRA.He said that measuring these periods to a precision of 10 seconds of a nano-second may help the IPTA experiment to discover Gravitational Waves with a period of about a billionth of a second.\u201cWe are extremely proud and happy that our facilities like the GMRT and the ORT are at a stage where they can meaningfully contribute to this global experiment. The highlight is the international community\u2019s interest in partnering with us as a result of our upgraded telescopes,\u201d Prof. Gupta said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "It\u2019s the summer holidays. I\u2019m a worm in the Instagram vortex one morning falling in deeper and deeper until I don\u2019t know where I began. We text each other from two rooms in the same home. \u201cAmmu I\u2019m the b word\u201d (bored) <smiley smiley hugs kisses heart> (sic). I am disgusted with myself and drag my daughter out to Commercial Street. We walk in the heat looking at trinkets, fake antiques, junk jewellery and shiny slippers. We walk briskly, wasting no time, it feels good to have an agenda for a moment. We slow down after a while and linger. We drink coconut water, slurp up the tender white flesh. My mother, who is with us, tries to match blouses to saris in a sari shop busier than a railway station. The saleswoman insists on bringing rolls of contrasting fabrics, orange for green, green for orange, insisting it is trending in the latest TV serials. My mother shakes her head, she doesn\u2019t succumb. This is fun, I think, it beats the lonely scrolling through Amazon, dropping things into a shopping cart icon. Here, they even give us a steaming cup of tea. We have lunch in an old-fashioned multi-cuisine restaurant, climbing the narrow stairs with ornate mirrors. Ceramic plates are served warm, there\u2019s sweet corn veg soup and finger bowls for when we are done \u2014 the ultimate in fine dining when we were growing up. The experience still beats every five-star meal I\u2019ve had till date. Especially the crisp conical wafer stuck in my ice cream next to the artificial cherry. Sound of gunsI explain this excitedly to my daughter. She still shares my enthusiasm for small mom-and-pop shops, auto rides and collecting flowers fallen from trees. Her eyes are not glazing over yet. We hear the sounds of guns and tinny music, a small boy in the next table is playing on his mobile phone while eating. I look around and see that barring one or two tables with older people, most have their heads in their phones. The elephant I tried to escape from at home is back.Let\u2019s talk about the elephant in my living room and your living room too. Are we letting our gadgets think for us, fantasise for us, live for us? I once saw a poster of a child and a tattooed prison inmate side by side. The lines in between them read: \u2018Children now spend less time outdoors than a prison inmate\u2019. This was chilling. Then I saw a beautiful photo titled \u2018Enlightening\u2019 by Gregoire A. Meyer of a Gothic stone sculpture of a woman lit by the glow of a phone she\u2019s holding. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but it seemed to be speaking to me about a very particular feeling. \n\n\n\n\n\nAm I overthinking it? Panicking about screen time and the impact of gadgets on us and our children? Maybe we gadget worms are like the bookworms of yore. Just more evolved; in tune with the times; tech-savvy. Bookworms were considered nerds, didn\u2019t speak much, wore thick glasses, had their heads in their books to escape reality, a small, serious, socially awkward tribe who didn\u2019t get much sun. Gadget worms have no distinguishing features, they are not defined by age or appearance; but they have a great appetite for content: news, editorials, TikTok videos, art, gossip, natural catastrophe videos, hate tweets \u2014 you name it. What did the poor bookworm do when his books were taken away? Did he lift his head and look around? Did he take a walk and smell the roses? I\u2019ve known bookworms who brought their books to the dining table and ate while reading; my daughter watches her tablet as she eats, sometimes I do too. The next day I plan another outing. We go to the bookshop. A rare one that lets you exchange old books for new. Its walls are filled with a vast collection of new and used books. I\u2019m a sucker for second-hand books. It\u2019s very romantic, reading a book that belonged to someone once. My daughter and I pick a bunch of books excitedly. I make her promise we will read every night for an hour. No looking at gadgets. She agrees. I have to bribe her a little \u2014 Trevor Noah\u2019s mother paid him to read, I tell her. We read that night, not for an hour but for more. When I look up sometime later, she\u2019s asleep with a book on her chest. I take the book, close it. I automatically reach for my phone, pause, change my mind and hit the lights. The elephant is still there in the darkness, I can feel him. But for now I ignore him. Tomorrow we are planning to eat dinner at the dining table, three of us. No gadgets in the vicinity.

      "\n\nHow netizens reacted to Apple\u2019s recent keynote \n",
      "Updated: June 15, 2019 15:37 IST\rPublished: June 15, 2019 15:37 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/wandering-around-the-web-apple-keynote-2019-ios-13-and-mac-pro/article27949328.ece",
      "Watching the Apple Keynote last week wasn\u2019t only to be among the first to know about the new releases to be anticipated. I had a feeling that there would be so many memes coming from this, that the Internet would possibly crash from it. Cheezburger, 9GAG, Reddit and 4chan all had their own aggregation of memes around the prices.And the Internet almost did crash when Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Software Engineering, announced the $6000 Mac Pro with its chrome cheese grater\u2026 but it was the $999 Mac Pro stand that had the Internet lost in a tsunami of tears, both laugh and sad varieties. At the event itself, the journalists, bloggers, engineers alike all clapped, but their live Twitter feeds reflected something else entirely: \u2018Tim Cook, are you serious?\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTuber (and co-creator of Crash Course, SciShow, Vlogbrothers and the mighty fanfest VidCon) Hank Green tweeted \u201cI thought it was a comedy\u2026\u201d and followed in the same thread with, \u201cIf you\u2019re considering spending $1000 on a monitor stand, I would like to talk with you about maternal health in Sierra Leone.\u201dSo let\u2019s do a run-down of some fun highlights. The announcement of the new macOS was inevitable; Catalina (I really would do anything to be in these macOS name brainstorming meetings) promises fun features like Sidecar, where you can set up their iPad as a secondary display.And in the age of digital well-being, Screen Time monitors and gives you feedback around the amount of time you spend on an app\u2026 because it\u2019s not enough to be obsessing over the Health app already.Apple also announces stronger triangulation services with Find My (the new combo of Find My Friends and Find My iPhone) because I\u2019d love to know when my friends steal my iPhone. Just kidding, it happened when I got mugged outside my apartment building in London by a total stranger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most hilarious, though, had to be the \u2018laying to rest\u2019 of iTunes. I mean, whenever iTunes opens on my Mac, it\u2019s usually by accident and I can\u2019t delete the darned thing! Now Apple\u2019s gotten the hint.When Dark Mode was announced for iOS 13, I admit I squealed at an unreasonably high volume. With my Twitter app always on Night Mode, I found my iPhone boding well at the thought of the continuation.Speaking of Twitter, over the past few days, it took the oh-so-necessary steps to make its rules easier for users to understand, reorganising them into safety, privacy and authenticity and tightening up the descriptions for each rule to match the social network\u2019s 280-character limit. Short rules often have loopholes. So be prepared for a barrage of \u2018okay\u2019, \u2018no, don\u2019t do that\u2019 and \u2018are you as serious about this tweet as Tim Cook is serious about the $999 Mac Pro?\u2019In a world of tech-fuelled outrage, Twitter\u2019s vice president of Trust And Safety, Del Harvey, penned a short blog post, explaining, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from about 2,500 words to under 600. In 280 characters or less, each rule clearly describes exactly what is not allowed on Twitter.\u201d Wait\u2026 does this mean my sarcasm won\u2019t be tolerated? Does this mean Trump will stop saying \u2018SAD\u2019? In that not-so-sad way? Nope. Platforms which could follow suit with this concise framework of rules include Facebook (big time), Instagram (their adopted child), WhatsApp (which might be impossible) and Snapchat.

      "\n\nWith a new campaign, Bumble India pushes Bizz\n\n",
      "Updated: June 14, 2019 16:10 IST\rPublished: June 14, 2019 14:06 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/bumble-pushes-bizz/article27914626.ece",
      "Over two months ago, Bumble, the dating-app-turned-networking-suite ran a smart campaign. Get on the app, sign into its professional networking vertical called Bizz, and match with Priyanka Chopra-Jonas \u2014 this would get you a shot at interning as a marketing assistant on the sets of the upcoming movie The Sky Is Pink, a project that she is co-producing with Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur. Now, to further the buzz around Bizz, they\u2019re kicking off Find Them On Bumble, starting 17th June. The campaign in Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru, will spotlight women entrepreneurs and women-driven businesses in India. Faces from different fields and backgrounds, and of all ages, have been brought on board. This includes the likes of Karishma Mehta, founder and CEO of the Humans of Bombay website; Pooja Dhingra, pastry chef and owner of the Le15 Patisserie chain; Falguni Peacock, luxury bridal-wear designer and co-founder of Falguni Shane Peacock; Namrata Purohit of the Pilates Studio; and Imaan Javan, a solar energy developer to name a few. \u201cThe idea is to go from digital to physical, and to encourage other women who may have similar aspirations, to connect and learn from them,\u201d says global director of strategy at Bumble, Priti Joshi, who is currently in India to oversee the campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ll also be doing offline events, which will also give our users the opportunity to potentially meet some of these women in real life,\u201d she adds.Bumble entered India only in December 2018. They came in not as a dating site as they did in the United States four years ago, but as a \u201cfull suite\u201d networking platform. This followed a laudable evolution narrative that came from the company keeping its ear to the ground. In early 2017, noticing a surge in Bumble users only looking for friends after romantic partners were found, the company went on to scale up with the \u2018BFF mode\u2019 for platonic relationships. Again, people Eventually, The same thing happened again, only this time, people had soon started making \u2018friends\u2019 in line with their professional interests.What they haven\u2019t compromised on through this trajectory, is their women-first credentials, pushing that forward aggressively in India with sometimes problematic slogans like \u201cambitious, not loose\u201d or \u201ccurious, not loose\u201d.Regardless, in half a year, Bumble has surpassed 10 lakh users in the country. Joshi says that Indian Bumble users have taken to the app\u2019s different modes in record numbers: \u201cIn India 60% of the female users are using more than one mode on Bumble, much higher than in other countries. It just goes to show that Indian women aren\u2019t just looking for empowered connections in love, or friendships or career \u2014 they want it all.\u201dBefore leaving for India, Joshi talked about the company\u2019s specific interest in Bizz for the Indian market, and consequently, on their learnings of the business, art, and entrepreneurial climate for women in the country. Edited excerpts.We had over 1 million registered users in India in just four months following our launch \u2014 and we have a total of over 60 million users in 150 countries around the world. We are very excited about this initial growth in our market in India. Women in India have made the first move over 2.5 million times. They are sending twice as many messages as women in the rest of the world. We\u2019re especially excited to see that our female user base in India has grown more than 1.5x faster than males, since launch.We understand that a lot of individuals might be in committed relationships \u2014 so the app has a provision where you can hide Date mode, so that you only have the other two, BFF and Bizz, showing up. Should you be interested in a romantic partner again, you can reintroduce the Date mode right back.No, you cannot turn off Bizz and BFF. The idea is that with Date mode, you find one person to stay committed to for a long time. You don\u2019t really need to go back on it. But from a BFF and Bizz standpoint, the need to connect with possible friends or professional contacts will vary at different times in your life.Not yet, since its only been a few months \u2014 but in a year\u2019s time maybe we should connect to see a time shift. What\u2019s exciting as I\u2019m digging into the metrics is that a majority of Indian women on Bizz are looking to network, find a mentor, a partner. They\u2019re looking for real, authentic one-to-one professional connections to go through a [work] experience together. They\u2019re also exploring the ideas of what it means to be a mentor or a mentee.The other interesting thing is that industry-wise, while marketing is one of the biggest categories, most of the Bizz users are interested in the arts \u2014 creatives, people in fashion, artists. Tech and media are the next few industries. That\u2019s a wonderfully diverse set.I can\u2019t speak for others, but what I can tell you is that, a lot of our younger women [on Bizz] are looking for internships and part-time work, which aligns with what we\u2019d have hypothesized. In women over 30, interest in tech fields tends to be a little bit higher. In women younger than this, an interest in the arts is high. This is what we\u2019re seeing in the last four to five months. It\u2019ll be easier over time to see how that changes or flows.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nTurkish artist Ugur Gallenkus.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n A Starbucks cup merging with a crowd around a dried-up well, or a yacht spliced with a boat full of refugees: powerful collages by a Turkish artist have taken the Internet by storm.With over half a million followers on Instagram and thousands more on Facebook and Twitter, 29-year-old Ugur Gallenkus has stirred a huge reaction by juxtaposing photos of misery in war-torn countries with the comforts of the West.His digital collages bring together photos he finds in the media that have similar compositions but tell entirely different stories.One features a little girl dressed in a Wonder Woman costume spliced together with a girl covered in blood and bandages \u2014 the sort of jarring contrast, which Mr. Gallenkus hopes will raise awareness of a \u201cparallel world\u201d.\u201cI would like to tell the world that people in developing countries live in war, hunger and pain. If we want to live in peace and harmony we must have knowledge about each others\u2019 lives,\u201d he said. Mr. Gallenkus first started the project in 2016 in reaction to the photo of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who was found drowned on a Turkish beach the year before, which sent shock waves around the world and became one of the most searing images of Europe\u2019s migrant crisis.\u201cOne morning while watching the news, I saw the fear and despair in the eyes of a group of immigrant families trying to cross the sea for a better life. \u201cThat shocked me and I decided to tell the world of their situation,\u201d said the Istanbul-based artist.Mr. Gallenkus says his work covers subjects from all over the world, including war, famine, violence against women, income inequality and climate change. \u201cBut the war and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan are an important part of my work,\u201d he stressed.In another piece, one side of the image shows a father bathing his children in the remnants of a bathroom destroyed by war, while the other side shows a clean, lavish bathroom with a fancy chandelier. \u201cI only interpret the images in a different way. I try to find the value and meaning of the photos that I see in the news and add the message I want to give to the world,\u201d he said.Thousands have commented on Mr. Gallenkus\u2019 social media feeds, expressing their anger, sorrow and shock. \u201cArt is powerful because it can express that which is beyond words. Praying for the healing of our world,\u201d Subra, a Facebook user, wrote under one image.\u201cI am from Syria. Every time I see your pictures and the destruction of my country compared to the comfortable life in the West, I cry. We used to have the same life, but war took everything from us,\u201d Haroun, another user, wrote.With all the messages of support from across the globe, Mr. Gallenkus says he is determined to continue his work in the hope of making the world a \u201chappy and beautiful place for all\u201d.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chennais-guide-for-subtitled-cinema/article27898243.ece",
      "\nA scene from Malayalam film \u2018Lucifer\u2019\n\u00a0 You walk into office on a Monday morning and find your colleagues passionately dissecting a Malayalam film that they caught over the weekend. Youfeel left out. And what do you do? You end up booking tickets for the evening show. But minutes into the movie; reality kicks in \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have English subtitles, and most of the movie is Greek and Latin (read: Malayalam) for you.But what if there was a forum that shared first-hand information about subtitles and subtitled shows? This was the moot question that drove Vinoth CJ (23) to create a Twitter handle called Subtitles Help, which has been passing information about the availability of subtitles for other language movies, played in the suburbs of Chennai, Coimbatore and Puducherry.\n\n\n\n\n\nVinoth CJ \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nAs marketing head of Sathya Jyothi Films, Vinoth\u2019s job required him to stay updated about the current trends in cinema. However, the lack of information about subtitles for movies in other languages was something that irked him quite often. \u201cI can understand Telugu to an extent, but it was difficult for me to follow Hindi and Malayalam movies. I noticed that a lot of people were raising this issue on social media. I thought: \u2018Why not start an initiative, where the information about subtitles comes through me?\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s how Subtitles Help came into existence in January this year. Vinoth feels that Chennaiites, lately, have been largely consuming other language films. \u201cThey are anyway going to watch the big star\u2019s films. However, they have also started showing interest in offbeat and niche subjects, which wasn\u2019t the case before. Recently, I received a lot of requests for the Malayalm film Virus,\u201d he adds.Vinoth makes sure that he posts information about subs a day before the film\u2019s release. So how does Subtitles Help operate? \u201cPVR, Sathyam and Inox are three key players in Chennai. I\u2019m in touch with their projection team and gather information from them. Since they are reliable, I\u2019m able to address 90% of audiences\u2019 queries,\u201d he says, about the process. Most requests come for urban centres like Sathyam and PVR, he says, adding, \u201cOddly, though, I haven\u2019t got any requests for Tamil films.\u201d Lost in translationSubtitles Help (@SubtitlesHelp on Twitter), launched in January this year, has has over 2,000 followers.There are similar accounts called Rally for Subtitles (Blore) and Mumbai Subtitles on Twitter.For tier-2 centres like Kasi, Rohini, Rakhi and Vetri, Vinoth personally verifies the information with theatre owners. \u201cMost of them are my friends, and we have a WhatsApp group. It is only a matter of 15 minutes,\u201d he says, adding that the highest number of requests he got was for the Hindi film Uri: The Surgical Strike. Only a few production houses are receptive to the idea of releasing their movies with subtitles, observes Vinoth. He goes on to add: \u201cThe Central Board for Film Certification has passed a rule saying that subtitles cannot be added after certification. So, production houses are in a rush to get their films certified without subs.\u201d"

But, you know, Australia and New Zealand, these are all very, very good teams,\u201d Mr. Pichai told a Washington audience that included US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and top corporate executives from India and the US during the India Ideas Summit of USIBC wherein he received the Global Leadership Award on Wednesday. He was replying to USIBC president Nisha Desai Biswal who asked \u201cwho do you think is going to play the final match\u201d.Pichai shared some of his cricket and baseball experiences in the United States.\u201cWhen I first came here, I tried to kind of adapt to baseball. I have to say it was a bit challenging. In my first game, I was proud because I hit the ball on the back. It\u2019s a really good shot in cricket. I was like, well look, what I did. But people didn\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn cricket when you run, you always take your bat with you. So I also ran between base with my bat as well. So eventually, I realised baseball was a bit difficult. I can adjust on many things, but I\u2019m going to stick to cricket,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.\u201cThere is a cricket World Cup going on. It\u2019s a wonderful tournament... rooting for India to do well.

      "\nFake news most prevalent on Facebook, but also appears on YouTube and Twitter.\n\u00a0 Eighty-six percent of Internet users have been duped by fake news \u2014 most of it spread on Facebook \u2014 according to a global survey published on Tuesday.Respondents said they want both governments and social media companies to crack down on these activities, which are contributing to a growing distrust of the Internet as well as negatively impacting economies and political discourse.The U.S. took the lion\u2019s share of the blame for spreading fake news, followed by Russia and China, according to the annual Ipsos survey of more than 25,000 Internet users in 25 countries.Fake news appeared to be most prevalent on Facebook, but also appears on YouTube, blogs and Twitter, the pollsters found.The results showed people in Egypt were the most gullible while respondents in Pakistan were the most sceptical. It also revealed widespread distrust of social media firms and growing concerns over privacy and biases baked into algorithms used by Internet companies.The poll \u2014 which relied on both in-person and online interviews \u2014 was conducted between December 21, 2018 and February 10, 2019 on behalf of the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI). \u201cThis year\u2019s survey not only underscores the fragility of the Internet, but also netizens\u2019 growing discomfort with social media and the power these corporations wield over their daily lives,\u201d CIGI\u2019s Fen Osler Hampson said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nA to I of artificial intelligence \n",
      "Updated: June 11, 2019 17:40 IST\rPublished: June 11, 2019 17:16 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/a-to-i-of-artificial-intelligence/article27799943.ece",
      "What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? How do you build it? How can it go wrong and what does our future look like with increased use of AI?These were just some of the questions that were discussed at the launch of the book, A Human\u2019s Guide to Machine Intelligence: How Algorithms Are Shaping Our Lives and How We Can Stay in Control by Kartik Hosanagar, at the Bangalore International Centre on June 8. Kartik, an alumnus of BITS Pilani, and at present, a tenured professor at Wharton, was in conversation with Ravi Gururaj, founder-CEO, QikPod.comAddressing a packed auditorium, Ravi kicked off the interaction by asking Kartik about a story mentioned in the book that took place all the way back in 1780. Hungarian inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen claimed to have invented a chess playing robot and invited Benjamin Franklin, then US ambassador to France to play against it. However, as Kartik put it, to much laughter from the audience, it was \u201cjugaad AI\u201d as there was a person inside the robot.The true origin of AI came with Alan Turing in the early 1950s when he wrote a paper, \u2018Can Machines Think\u2019, and devised what came to be known as the Turing test. Kartik said, \u201cIf you want computers to do intelligent things, the question is how? There are many ways to build AI. One, which is used quite a lot, is the expert system approach. You observe human experts doing intelligent things and you ask them how they did they do it. These systems work reasonably well but at the end of the day, they cannot match human intelligence. The second approach, which is the dominant approach today, involves observing people in action, collecting a lot of data and the system extracts patterns from that data. This is the statistical approach known as machine learning.\u201dKartik added that modern AI systems are highly capable. He said, \u201cFacebook\u2019s algorithm figures out what stories to show you and which not to bother showing, companies are working on AI-based medical diagnosis, recruitment is done based on algorithms screening resumes, and in courtrooms in the US, there are algorithms that predict the likelihood that the defendant will re-offend and the judge passes the sentence based on that.\u201dRavi then asked the big question of what happens if the algorithm is wrong? Kartik said that for every example he provided in the book, he also gave counter examples of things going wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2010, there was a \u2018flash crash\u2019 in the stock market. One trillion US dollars of market value was wiped out in 34 minutes. Analysis showed that the algorithms were feeding off each other and selling based on what the other algorithm was doing. Another example is of a study that found that Amazon\u2019s resume screening had a gender bias.\u201d As for where these biases come from, Kartik said: \u201cIt\u2019s not like a programmer is programming these biases in and saying reject the application when it\u2019s a woman. \u201cAs I mentioned, machine learning is all about learning from data. So, the question is what kind of data do you feed the system? So, Amazon would have said let us look at all the applicants, let us look at who got the actual job offer, let us look at who actually got promotions in the workplace and let\u2019s now create an algorithm that mimics that. If there was gender bias, conscious or unconscious, then the algorithm picks that [up] and becomes biased. The data becomes the driver of the AI behaviour.\u201dAs for who controls the knob and polices this as Ravi put it, Kartik said, \u201cRight now, it\u2019s the data scientist who is writing 20 to 30 lines of code. The question is, is the person also adding a bunch of tests. For example, test for gender bias. It comes down to the data scientists and what tests they do. I don\u2019t think the mindset of testing for bias, testing for security issues is there in data science. \u201d He stated, \u201cCompanies that are deploying algorithms in socially important settings should have an audit process that goes through very formal checks. Even things such as data security, privacy and fairness. Tests like these are going to be important when looking to deploy algorithms in socially important settings.\u201d The floor was then thrown open to the audience. Questions ranged from ethical AI, about when AI would be used in the farm sector, the risk to privacy, conscious AI and fintech.Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, who was present in the audience, said, \u201cThe ability to define purpose and goal is truly what distinguishes a human being from a machine...\u201d\u201cI think you just made a brilliant point,\u201d Kartik replied. \u201cWe keep asking as AI can match what humans are doing, what is left for humans to do? Well-defined tasks are very easy for AI systems to do. For example, if we are talking about companies, creative tasks such as where should the company be headed? Those are very different kind of problems. The AI system can\u2019t say, \u2018okay the company should be headed here\u2019. It can help inform that decision. That\u2019s where AI will be relevant. \u201cIn fact, a lot of people worry about AI and job loss and indeed, that will happen. But, I believe AI will play a huge augmentation role. This question of purpose and goal, it will be informed by AI systems that help us identify what is the most relevant data we should look at and make us more efficient.\u201dHe added, \u201cOverall, I am an optimist about AI.\u201d The interaction ended with Ravi inviting Kartik back every two years to give an update on AI. Kartik responded, to much laughter from the audience, \u201cTwo years from now, I will have an AI system to answer your questions!\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThis Friday, March 10, 2017, file photo shows the WhatsApp communications app on a smartphone, in New York. WhatsApp says a vulnerability in the popular communications app let mobile phones be infected with sophisticated spyware with a missed in-app call alone. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n  Facebook has honoured a Manipuri man for discovering a WhatsApp bug that violated the privacy of a user.Zonel Sougaijam, a 22-year-old civil engineer, said that the social media giant awarded $5000 to him and also included him in the \u2018Facebook Hall of Fame 2019\u2019, for detecting the WhatsApp bug. Mr. Sougaijam\u2019s name is currently at the 16th position in a list of 94 people, in the \u2018Facebook Hall of Fame\u2019 for this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this March 29, 2018 file photo, the logo for social media giant Facebook, appears on screens at the Nasdaq MarketSite, in New York's Times Square. \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nAP\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cDuring a voice call through WhatsApp, the bug used to allow the caller to upgrade it to a video call without the authorisation and knowledge of the receiver. The caller was then able to see what the other person was doing, violating the privacy of the receiver,\u201d Mr. Sougaijam told PTI. After discovering the bug, Mr. Sougaijam said, he had reported the matter to the Bug Bounty Program of the Facebook, which deals with violation of privacy matters, in March. He said his report was acknowledged by the Facebook Security team the very next day and its technical department fixed the bug within 15-20 days.\u201cAfter reviewing this issue, we have decided to award you a bounty of $5000,\u201d Facebook said in an e-mail sent to Mr. Sougaijam. The man said he found his name in the Facebook \u2018 Hall of Fame\u2019 page this month.

      " We have a new kid on the block: blockchain. No, this is not just bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, just as the Internet is not merely email. This niche technology platform is, as the name suggests, a chain of blocks; and a block is a set of files containing information. In layman\u2019s terms, blockchain is a vast networked database; but unlike conventional systems, there is no one central authority, the records are all shared among the members of the network. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blockchained India team \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nby arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nBlockchain might be confusing to understand, but the excitement it has created is not without reason, largely due to its far-reaching potential. It\u2019s already hugely disruptive in ways we hadn\u2019t ever imagined. Blockchained India, a network of this fintech\u2019s champions, will host a conclave \u2014 India Dapp Fest 2019 \u2014 in Bengaluru from June 11 to 15. Billed as the \u2018festival of blockchain\u2019 and one of the biggest such gatherings in Asia, it will unite a vast number of enthusiasts and practitioners of this platform, both from India and abroad, and it promises to provide \u201ca first-hand perspective and highly impactful insights not seen anywhere else.\u201d The first three days of the event will see multi-track hackathon and workshops, and during the remaining two days, there will be conferences, with as many as 25% of the speakers from abroad. \u201cWe are looking at around 1,000 people participating in the five days; most of them will be developers and the rest will be the ones who will help take the developers to the next level,\u201d says Akshay Aggarwal, national head and co-founder, Blockchained India. The event will showcase a number of distributed apps. \u201cThey might be nascent, but there are opportunities for everyone,\u201d he says. Charting the growth of blockchain in the recent past, Akshay says, \u201cWhen we organised India Blockchain Week in September 2017, barely anyone was looking at it the way we were looking at. It\u2019s no longer India-specific, it\u2019s global. And, many of the enthusiasts are today practitioners.\u201d Speakers worth a waiting earJaspreet Bindra: Founder, Digital MattersJessica Zartler: Blockchain anthropologistRong Chen: Chairman of Elastos FoundationNitin Gaur: Director, Digital Assets WW, IBMAlicia Ferratusco: Co-founder and CBO at Starfish NetworkAnderson Tan: Managing general partner of Alpha Omega CapitalBernd Oostrum: CEO and co-founder of TezsureKumar Anirudha: CEO and co-founder, Acyclic LabsDavid Casey: CEO and co-founder of NuMundoJonathan Cosino Jaranilla: Co-founder of Ledger AtlasManav Ailawadi, co-founder, Blockchained India, says Bengaluru was chosen as the venue since it has the perfect environment for an event like India Dapp Fest. \u201cIt is the Silicon Valley of the country. Most of the big enterprises are here, so most of the innovations in technology also happen here. The city has a vibrant technology and startup ecosystem.\u201d The theme of the conference will be not just to promote the platform and help in the creation of applications, but also to spread awareness about the immense potential that blockchain has to improve the efficiency in the processes of various sectors.The hackathon \u2014 which will basically be setting problem statements for crowd-sourced innovation and then mentoring the participants to build impactful solutions \u2014 is free to attend and is open to all. It is being held with the aim of coming up with innovative solutions for all fields \u2014 there will be a wide range of topics from enterprise-grade blockchains to public networks and decentralised market places. The tracks for the hackathon will be revealed at the venue. Each team can have up to four members and there will be special prizes for an all-girls team. Those who can\u2019t code can also take part, but it is better they team up with someone who can code. It is open to those who are very new to technology as well. The workshops that will happen alongside will have experts to provide hands-on guidance to build on different platforms. The participants will also be able to take forward their work by interacting with enterprises and investors. The last two days of the five-day event will feature conferences, during which speakers with a wide experience in the blockchain ecosystem will provide first-hand perspectives and insights. There won\u2019t be live streaming, but fans of the technology who might not be able to make it to the event can look forward to videos on the website.If you haven\u2019t heard of Jaspreet Bindra, one of the speakers at Dapp Fest, we\u2019ll bring you up to speed; he\u2019s the founder of advisory firm Digital Matters, which makes moves with regard to blockchain among other things. He points out blockchain resolves two problems that internet hasn\u2019t been able to solve. \u201cInternet solved the information problem with search; it solved the distribution problem with platforms like YouTube, Amazon etc; it solved the communication problem with email, messenger, chat, etc. But very few people have trust in the internet because of false information and security issues. Internet was supposed to bring in one level playing field, with no intermediaries. But it has actually created more intermediaries than before, like huge software, social media and e-comm companies.\u201dJust like with Artificial Intelligence, there is a scramble to embrace the new technology because it comes with a lot of promises. In a PwC survey of 600 executives from 15 territories in 2018, as many as 84% said that their organisations have some association with blockchain technology. According to Gartner, by 2030, the annual business value generated by blockchain will be more than US$3 trillion.Perhaps, this is why experts, including Akshay, observe that blockchain platforms are already a reality and some of the issues are getting resolved as we speak. He concludes, \u201cThe next stage is the mass adoption of these apps. An event like India Dapp Fest will be the ideal occasion for companies to make the best of this new technology.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nThe age of Virtual Reality fitness is here: are India gyms ready?\n\n",

      "Playing tennis on your Wii is so five seasons ago! It\u2019s not a satisfying workout to simply swing your arm forward and backward dressed in pyjamas in your living room, knowing full well you\u2019ll be back on the couch diving into some biryani.Enter Virtual Reality to take your gaming and your workout to a whole new level. One of the biggest players in this fitness subculture is Black Box VR, the first VR gym. Located in San Francisco, they won \u2018best startup\u2019 at 2018\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show.\u201cThe programmes that are implemented in the Black Box VR game were created by top trainers and exercise scientists. Based on over 100 exercise studies, your body will see immediate improvements that match or beat traditional exercise programmes. You will push harder and work out more consistently, even if it feels like a fun sport!\u201d says the Black Box VR website.\n\n\n\n\n\n So how does it work? Forget standing in an airy, brightly-lit gym with other people sweating it out \u2014 at Black Box VR, much like the name, you stand in a dark space. But you\u2019re not just wearing the headgear you\u2019d wear for a video game. While in a totally private room, your body is strapped with ergonomic sensors and controllers, so your focus is on the task at hand, working out using the equipment around you.So what\u2019s the actual experience like? Virtually placed in visceral environments, fight your way through a tsunami and exercise those glutes, calves and hamstrings, brave tough blizzards with dead-lift equipment working your pectorals, back and biceps, conquer the earth and fiery environments using your chest and shoulder muscles... you can embody Bear Grylls without going anywhere near a mound of dirt! Black Box VR claims Virtual Reality fitness can be tailored to any scale of fitness level, whether you\u2019re just taking up that New Year\u2019s resolution or you have the stamina of a gladiator.Feedback is everythingWe can look to a June 2017 study by University of Kent\u2019s School of Engineering and Digital Arts research team led by Maria Matsangidou in which isometric bicep curl sets were done at 20% of the maximum weight test subjects could lift, which they were then asked to hold for as they could.In the same room, a VR-equipped group who saw the same environment, including a visual representation of an arm and the weight, and carried out the same lift and hold as the non-VR group.The study showed a clear reduction in perception of pain and effort when using VR tech, explaining, \u201cAltered visual feedback may increase or decrease the pain perception based on the visual proprioceptive feedback.\u201dThe Artificial Intelligence in the system learns your workout pattern and, with real-time resistance, ups the ante for you by adjusting the machines and the simulations accordingly. Plus, the AI, easy to use by even the tech-illiterate, will inform you if your form needs to shift.Google \u2018Virtual Reality fitness India,\u2019 and you sadly won\u2019t get satisfying results. Some gyms state they are a VR fitness zone, but actually just have a widescreen television set up opposite a treadmill. (Be sure to look out for these spaces by calling ahead and finding out if they have the genuine equipment.) Virtual Reality workouts haven\u2019t really made a home in India, but some have plenty of hope.Abhinav Shankar, a software engineer, shares, \u201cI am at my desk for about 10 hours a day, so the gym is important to my mental and physical well-being. I work out everyday \u2014 Sunday included. I have dabbled in VR gaming and have also heard of VR fitness. While I don\u2019t know what the requirements are in India for a Virtual Reality gym (because I am sure there may be a regulations worry), it sounds like an exciting venture. But I don\u2019t know how ready the market is for it.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that a space needs to be VR-ready, totally separate from a mainstream gym; no sound or light interferences which may interrupt the flow of a session. There\u2019s also the massive amounts of data required to run an AI programme with VR.Ultimately, Virtual Reality, tapping into some already fitness-fanatic societies in the country, still requires some patience. Some point out that bottom-line gym etiquette needs to evolve progressively for this technology to even be considered, from people not wiping the gym equipment after a workout in a shared gym to hogging the equipment. So imagine sharing a VR ensemble with someone else\u2019s sweat on it.But we have to be fairly sceptical of Virtual Reality and fitness. While VR itself seems to be an effective tool in pain management, it\u2019s worth noting the considerable amount of time required to maintain and clean the equipment \u2014 something which needs expert technicians. So how do trainers feel about this potential entrant to the fitness market?Even in the UK, where the age of boutique gyms is reaching peak saturation, VR fitness is yet to make itself known, according to Tamsa Madzimbamuto-Ray, health and well-being physiologist at Nuffield Health in London. \u201cThere are so many factors to consider; the health and safety implications being the most important ones, plus the regulation and moderation of the VR usage by gyms.\u201dFitness trainer Bilon Aristotle, based in Hyderabad, explains why the market may not be ready for it. \u201cWe live in a place where we can easily go engage in adventure sports and the satisfaction of such a workout is more real. As a trainer, I love to go to the gym, smell the iron, work up a sweat and see the workouts around me. See, it\u2019s like in The Matrix in which Cypher eats a steak. He knows full well it\u2019s not real. We\u2019ll always go back to the classics.\u201d Plus, we\u2019ve got to admit, there\u2019s nothing quite like having a real-life trainer know your history of strengths, weaknesses and limitations; your workout journey is essentially amplified by the interpersonal experience you\u2019d miss out having an AI-driven session.Our next worry as potential consumers: is it actually addictive? After all, the immersive nature of the equipment for VR workouts needs to be standardised by local industries and there don\u2019t seem to be any bodies in India dedicated to such psychological analyses just yet. In the meantime, be happy with a gaming session with your Oculus or a hike in the \u2014 ew \u2014 real hills.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nActor Vadivelu is a famous meme face\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAlbert Francis J\n A few days ago, Twitter exploded with messages of concern pouring in for Contractor Naesamani, after he was injured in a freak accident.His offence? Not letting his labourer Krishnamurthy know the difference between thevai ulla aani and thevai illatha aani!As a result, a hammer was dropped on his head though Krishnamurthy\u2019s culpability was never established. Around the same time, Twitterati were vigorously debating the Centre\u2019s suggestion to add Hindi as a third language, raising a united voice of opposition to stop this perceived Hindi imposition.N Karthik, a full-time marketing professional, and a part-time \u2018meme engineer\u2019, was sitting at his office table and sipping a cup of tea, watching things unfold on Twitter. On a break from work, he scrolled through the numerous meme templates he had downloaded onto his phone, and finally zeroed in on two that he thought fit the situation.One was a still from the film Friends (2001), taken moments before Naesamani was grievously injured. The other was a still from the film Arasu (2003), which showed Naesamani\u2019s alter ego Pichumani being harangued by a Hindi-speaking family.The caption read, \u201cSuch a world famous contractor Naesamani. He never knew Hindi and he still got a Government job!\u201d The context here is: actor Vadivelu, who played both characters, has a comedy track in the film Arasu about him landing a Government job.\u201cThat meme did the rounds,\u201d says Karthik, who runs the \u2018Bypass Buffalo\u2019 meme page on Facebook.For the uninitiated, a meme is a Gen Z discovery. It is where one or more images, preferably stills from a popular movie or a TV series, are juxtaposed with relevant social commentary that is laced with humour.Memes are so popular that even the septuagenarian President of the United States, Donald Trump, relies on it to promote his agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in a meme?\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nMihir Balantrapu\n \n\n\n\n\nBut whether in the US, or closer home, meme makers, especially Tamil meme producers, have risen in prominence so much that even filmmakers have started paying attention.\u201cIt is surprising to note that these dialogues (commentary) come from people who are not writers,\u201d says filmmaker Raju Murugan, who believes that satire in social media is the next level of progress in a democracy.\u201cThey pose a challenge to those of us in the industry... when we develop our content, we are in a position to find something better to entertain the public,\u201d Murugan adds.So, what works for a meme?\u201cIn any form of communication, one thing that stands out and takes the message to people is humour,\u201d says Karthik, adding that film templates are used because the relatability quotient is higher.\u201cConsidering the attention span of a millennial, memes are the easiest way to educate and inform people about various issues,\u201d says Guru Nicketan, a stand-up comic, and a proud meme creator.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuru Nicketan\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNicketan runs a popular Instagram account (@nicketronix), his platform to share memes on everything under the sun. \u201cI dedicate at least 60-90 minutes a day on memes,\u201d he adds.But for some like Raja* \u2014 one of the six admins behind \u2018Okali memes\u2019 on Facebook \u2014 the process is a pastime. Raja, and the other admins, are all college students between the ages of 17 and 23.These meme makers built a niche fan base for their content by ridiculing Tamil films, and its investors. \u201cWe spare none in Kollywood. We mostly use actors Vijay and Ajith for our memes. We don\u2019t hate them, obviously, but we cannot tolerate their fans,\u201d laughs Raja.As with any creative work, meme making is a process \u2018the artiste\u2019 must endure.\u201cThere\u2019s always a Vadivelu template for every situation. But I prefer using templates from my favourite films like Panchatanthiram, Alaipayuthey and Vaaranam Aayiram. It\u2019s similar to writing stand-up material. But the key is that the meme needs to be short, crisp and relatable,\u201d says Nicketan.Choosing the right template is dependent on your \u2018MQ\u2019, or meme quotient, says Karthik.\u201cIt is based entirely on your knowledge of Tamil film comedy tracks,\u201d he says. Though the bandwidth for social commentary on a meme is limitless, he believes that a meme won\u2019t click if it appears intellectual.\u201cEven for my meme about Hindi imposition, instead of Vadivelu, I could have used a picture of Google CEO Sundar Pichai. I read in a newspaper article that when he visited IIT Kharagpur, he admitted to not knowing Hindi. I could have spun a meme on that, but the problem is it would have seemed too serious, and it may not have trended as much,\u201d says Karthik.But if a picture conveys a thousand words, a meme can convey 10,000 words! Which is why film producers now sense an opportunity to promote their movies through memes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPut Chutney\u2019s Rajmohan Arumugam\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen earlier producers would try convincing the media to write good things about their films, they do the same with meme pages now,\u201d says Rajmohan Arumugam of YouTube channel Put Chutney.\u201cI notice the way two people think \u2014 politicians and film producers. Because I believe they look at future trends, and they both seem to be sold on the meme culture in Tamil Nadu,\u201d he adds.Nicketan too believes that memes would continue to grow. \u201cDigital media is expanding. It is likely that corporate companies would want to invest in meme makers,\u201d he says.An example of this marketing communication behaviour was noticed when a Tamil TV channel, a paint company and a music label all used the #Pray_For_Naesamani hashtag to push their content.But the problem with unregulated free speech in India is that neither of those are true. Nothing is ever unregulated, and speech isn\u2019t as free as you think it is.Meme for dummies by Guru NicketanKeep it simple and understandable for a better reach.Relatability will fetch you brownie points.See how you can twist the context with the templates.Captions that are crisp and short always help.Raja and his team discovered this when they started getting abusive messages, and even death threats. \u201cWe have never taken them seriously, so we reply with a witty comment or ignore the lot altogether. But we stay away from doing memes on political or sensitive topics. People can be very touchy about it,\u201d says Raja.The flip side is that memes also play into the hands of social media influencers keen on spreading fake news, and promoting a divisive agenda.Murugan has the final word on it. \u201cWhen the situation is such that anyone can satire anything, there will be a lot of bosh and baloney. But no change has ever happened without mishaps.\u201d(With inputs by Srinivasa Ramanujam, Srivatsan S and Abhirami Rao)"

      "\nTechnology has the potential to make visually impaired users more independent, says Vaasippom founder S. Ravikumar. File picture shows visually challenged students browsing at the Resource Centre for Differently Abled, in Loyola College, Chennai. Photo: S. Thanthoni/The Hindu\n\u00a0 Technology may have upended traditional print media forever, but more people are into reading than ever before. Digital archiving and databases have made it possible for niche sections of the reading public, such as the visually challenged, to dip into the same pool as everyone else when it comes to electronic and audio books.One such online resource is \u2018Vaasippom\u2019 (Let Us Read), an online Tamil library for visually impaired people. Started in 2017 with the aim of creating a centralised system of electronic learning materials in Tamil for visually impaired users, Vaasippom currently has 250 registered members from across the world, and 14 sighted volunteers from Tiruchi, Madurai, Coimbatore and Chennai, who are in charge of reading and recording texts.\u201cI started as a volunteer in a reading centre in Chennai, and later joined a Google group for the visually impaired. While sharing electronic and audio books, I realised that there was no central database of what we were working on. I started Vaasippom to connect users and volunteers and also minimise repetition,\u201d says S Ravikumar, founder of the web resource, and a software professional based out of Chennai.Ironing out the techRavikumar also noticed that the available texts were predominantly in English, and as such, were automatically compatible with the existing software. \u201cTamil has to be transcribed with the help of Unicode (an international encoding standard for languages by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs). We wanted to reach out to people who were having trouble finding good quality material in Tamil,\u201d he says.Vaasippom started with 18 audio-books and 120 e-books, and currently has 300 volumes in each of the formats. E-books are available in WORD, HTML, EPUB, MOBI versions, and have an advantage over audio, because screen-reading software (NVDA/JAWS/E Speak) enable visually impaired users to \u2018read\u2019 books independently.In the case of audio books, volunteers use their mobile phones or digital voice recorders and forward their clips to Ravikumar, who checks for textual and technical quality before uploading them on Vaasippom. \u201cWe advise our readers to do their recording in a calm studio-like environment, and take regular half-hour breaks to ensure a consistent reading style. It takes a reader 10 hours to record 300 printed pages,\u201d says Ravikumar.As recording technology has evolved from magnetic audio tapes to compact disks, USB drives, IC recorders, screen reading software, and even Optical Character Recognition (OCR), it has reduced the visually impaired user\u2019s need for a human aide, says Ravikumar. VAASIPPOM IN NUMBERS 300 E-books, covering 169 writers, from 24 sources 300 audio books, covering 167 writers, from 67 publishers, recorded by 72 readers 2119 hours of recording 9226 total number of files\u201cAt first I felt that this was something that the visually impaired needed because they didn\u2019t have any other option. But within a year of starting Vaasippom, I was pleasantly surprised to see that technology has actually made them so independent that they are now developing web pages, software and even operating systems on their own,\u201d he says. Responsible reading On popular demand, Vaasippom lists out creative writing by visually impaired members on a separate page. Ravikumar is also mulling a section on radio plays done by visually impaired actors.He has also started a section called \u2018Namakku Naame\u2019 (We, for Ourselves), which encourages members to contribute a small sum every month to create a book-buying fund for the group. \u201cWe have 70 people who have subscribed to this scheme. It allows Vaasippom to focus on the specific titles that our members want, without having to rely on donors to buy them for us,\u201d says Ravikumar. \u201cThis also makes people more actively involved in the book selection process.\u201d Vaasippom\u2019s greatest success has been the transcription of the new Tamil Nadu school syllabus text-books which are used by Government school teachers, students and people who are preparing for competitive exams.The library keeps the buzz going with group chats on WhatsApp and Google, overcoming geographical and physical barriers. \u201cAmong the books that we are really proud of having in our database is an audio version of K Venkatesan\u2019s Inthiya Varalaru (Indian History), done by our volunteers Sudha and Prabha, and a dramatised Tamil translation of Harry Potter by visually impaired users,\u201d says Ravikumar.As the demand for English texts grows, Ravikumar feels Vaasippom should get at least a thousand Tamil titles on its database first. \u201cAs a society, we have a long way to go when it comes to saving literature. Digital archiving is one possible solution to reclaim what we have lost in its original version,\u201d he says.More details on vaasippom.blogspot.comYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nHow Swarovski is changing up the chandelier\n\n",
      "Updated: June 7, 2019 16:25 IST\rPublished: June 7, 2019 16:25 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/how-swarovski-is-changing-up-the-chandelier/article27653323.ece",
      "When Baz Luhrmann\u2019s The Great Gatsby won an Oscar for Best Production Design in 2014, the opulent chandeliers in Tom Buchanan\u2019s palatial East Egg house were one of the things we remembered. The crystal creations were custom-made to fit the aesthetic of the time, by artistes and engineers at Swarovski\u2019s lighting division at Plattsburgh, New York (a four-hour drive from where the movie is set). These hand-crafted chandeliers are getting a modern makeover as the company sets its sights on being future-ready, says Roger Carthew, Senior Vice President of Swarovski\u2019s Global Lighting Business. Although he was to be in Chennai last week for the launch of Drapes & Dreams \u2014 their fourth address in the country and first in the South \u2014 a visa snafu means we end up speaking on the phone, instead of under twinkling crystal lights. \n\n\n\n\n\nNine Schonbek creations featured in The Great Gatsby \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia is a priority market, he states. \u201cThere is a strong, growing economy, as well as the connection with crystals, and Swarovski as a brand. So it was really about finding the right partners.\u201d While traditional styles are a perennial favourite, he says there is a marked move towards contemporary products, with cleaner lines, a minimalist aesthetic and LED technology. Even as architecture, home d\u00e9cor trends and a demand for multi-functional lighting impact their work, the brand has stepped into the home automation space with a line called Infinite Aura, launched last year. \u201cWe were looking for a product that re-imagined what chandeliers could look like in five years,\u201d he says, adding that it was created in consultation with San Francisco-based design firm, Ideo. \n\n\n\n\n\nCyanometer by Marjan van Aubel is made using the same technology as the Swarovski Infitine Aura range \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-functional pieces are controlled by a standalone app. \u201cIt has the ability to be a functional light when your kids are doing their homework, and when you\u2019re hosting dinner, it can set the ambience, and be a discussion piece,\u201d he says. The same technology was used by Marjan van Aubel in her winning entry for the Swarovski Designers of the Future Prize, which was showcased at the Salon del Mobile in Milan last month. It will also be brought to the Indian market during the festive season.While he doesn\u2019t share exact figures, Carthew says it is \u201cthe biggest investment we\u2019ve ever made in product development for lighting\u201d. This included the external consultancy, app development and custom LED boards. It is also a technology that can be incorporated into their more traditional chandeliers. Currently, they are in the process of researching what buyers would want from a tech point of view. \u201cSometimes, they just want it to be beautiful to look at,\u201d he says (from approximately \u20b91.38 lakh for a sconce to \u20b93.46 lakh for a large pendant).What started in 1966 with the Sputnik chandelier, which still graces the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, now has operations spanning North America, Europe and Asia. \u201cWe\u2019ve evolved into two verticals: consumer-driven retail, and a bespoke chandelier business. In 2007, we also acquired Schonbek, for their handmade tradition,\u201d he says. They are still a small percentage of the decorative lighting segment, but \u201cwe are keen on growing\u201d, Carthew says. As part of their bespoke range, Swarovski also customises their retail offerings. \u201cWe are seeing less formal dining areas and more open plan, casual living spaces. So we\u2019re moving away from designing for big entryway or foyer chandeliers, and are looking at ceiling pendant pieces,\u201d explains Carthew. \n\n\n\n\n\nA close up of Cascade by Vincent Van Duysen \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, they work on large, complex installations, too, conceptualised by their design and engineering team. Currently, this includes projects in Mumbai with Mukesh Ambani. They also work with architects like Steve Leung, who recently created an installation called \u2018Shades in Ascent,\u2019 which illuminated the entrance of Art Central in Hong Kong.The brand has always been open to working with artistes across genres, and it is no different with their lighting segment. Under the Crystal Palace programme, they\u2019ve collaborated with more than 60 designers over 15 years, including Zaha Hadid, Yves Behar and Tom Dixon. \u201cWe understand that collaborating with local, well-known designers is important to create excitement. It has traditionally been very European-centric, but we are in talks with a Chinese designer for a 2020 collection. While nothing has been confirmed in India, we definitely have plans for it in the near future,\u201d he assures. Swarovski Lighting is available in Chennai at Drapes and Dreams, Nungambakkam. Chandeliers upwards of \u20b91.25 lakh; ceiling lights from \u20b979,000. Schonbek\u2019s bespoke range starts from \u20b91.25 lakh. 7550277666You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA fourth-generation iPod Nano. The first iPods came out shortly after iTunes itself in 2001.\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images/ iStock\n On the morning of September 9, 2014, unsuspecting iTunes users \u2014 500 million of them \u2014 woke up to a quite smelly surprise. They\u2019d been \u2018gifted\u2019 the new U2 album, Songs Of Innocence, against their will. And you couldn\u2019t delete it; Apple had to provide proper instructions on how to. As you\u2019d expect, the stunt was not well received, and within a month, the U2 frontman, Bono himself, had to offer an apology. It was an enjoyable disaster, but one that\u2019s unlikely to be reprised anytime soon.Because iTunes is now dead. Apple has done it again. As they announced this past week, they plan to discontinue their somewhat iconic software in favour of having separate apps for different kinds of entertainment.The role iTunes performed \u2014 to varying degrees of success for close to two decades \u2014 will be shared by three apps: Apple Music, Podcasts, and Apple TV.\u2018Disruption\u2019 in the tech world has become a convenient buzzword for radical progress. But, crucially, music is an activity that begs for habit-forming. Familiarity with the setting, the gear used, the software or streaming service employed, as well as the songs themselves, all add to the experience in intangible ways. So while iTunes had its detractors because of its clunky interface, it remained a tool a lot of people had gotten used to, as they\u2019d arranged all their music into one consolidated library.Restless techWhile this latest decision isn\u2019t quite as bizarre (or evil) as Apple getting rid of the headphone jack from their iPhones, it still speaks of a kind of restlessness in technology that\u2019s gravely at odds with the process of listening to music.In 1999, the ugly world of music was obliterated by Napster, which enabled P2P sharing of music on a large scale and brought the industry to its knees. The shift from music via CDs to direct download MP3s had kicked off in earnest. Apple provided a blueprint to capitalise on this in 2001, first launching iTunes, which became a marketplace for selling music digitally. And then with the landmark iPod, which led to a mass shift in listener behaviour once more.That\u2019s what invariably happens with music. When I was growing up in the 90s, the primary means of consuming music was through television \u2014 remember Chitrahaar? Movies had songs, and there was also that ratty old device called a transistor radio. Soon, we moved on to playing tapes off 2-in-1s (or \u201cdecks\u201d) and the really quite radical Walkman. Basically, ever since I can remember, the way I listen to music has been defined not by my preference in format, but by whatever technology is shoved at me, depending of course on affordability.From tapes, we moved to CDs. A few years of getting into that, and boom, Napster blew up the algorithm. Illegality aside, the software gave power to the listener; we got to decide what, when, where, and how. The iPod followed a couple of years later. And so we plodded along for a decade or so, getting used to this mix of CDs and digital music.Over the past few years, there\u2019s been yet another shift. Notice how people send links to music through WhatsApp a lot more? Everyone now uses a mobile phone as their primary device. It\u2019s the coming together of a lot of factors: accessibility and affordability of smartphones, fast and cheap mobile internet in a post-Jio world, and the rise of streaming services.iTunes\u2019s descent, first into obscurity and now extinction, is perhaps indicative of this shift, as people prefer phones now.In the past three decades alone, we\u2019ve bounced from format to format, getting used to one, then being treated to a whole new one altogether. It\u2019s almost like an arms race, and one that seems to be at loggerheads with the very thing it\u2019s trying to improve: Do we really need a sleeker interface? Why are wired headphones on their way to becoming redundant?I doubt I\u2019ll miss it \u2014 habit-forming takes but a few weeks \u2014 but the end of iTunes does also seem like the end of yet another era.The writer is an author and freelance culture writer from New Delhi who wishes he\u2019d studied engineering instead.\u00a0You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google LLC, speaks during an event at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, U.S., in March. \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nBloomberg\n  Google\u2019s Cloud gaming service Stadia, which is intended to stream games on TVs, computers and smartphones, is set to hit the markets in November.The gaming service would first be made available in Belgium, Finland, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US, GSMArena reported on Thursday. During the launch, it will only be available on the Pixel 3, 3 XL, 3a and 3a XL smsartphones. The game would launch in two service tiers \u2014\u2014 Stadia Base, which would be the free version and Stadia Pro, which would cost $9.99 per month. According to the report, Stadia Base would only be available in 2020 and users wanting to purchase it this year would have to pay $129 for \u201cStadia Founder\u2019s Edition\u201d bundle. But, to users\u2019 disappointment, subscribing to Stadia Pro for $9.99 per month would not include any games unless they go for the bundle package mentioned above. Users would still need to pay for every title they want to play, regardless of whether they are using the free tier or the paid one. Then again, with Pro \u201cadditional free games released regularly\u201d and \u201cexclusive discounts on select game purchases\u201d are promised and neither of which would be made available with Stadia Base. As of now, Google has not disclosed exactly how much each game is going to cost, the report said. Already up for pre\u2014order on the Google Store, the service already consists of a limited\u2014edition Night Blue Stadia controller, a Chromecast Ultra, a three\u2014month subscription to Stadia Pro and an access to Destiny 2: The Collection. Google\u2019s Stadia Cloud gaming service would launch with 31 games including Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, Doom Eternal, Doom (2016), Rage 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Destiny 2 and Get Packed among others, the report added. Originally announced earlier in March, the system would work like a Netflix account for video games.

      "\nOne for all: We debate the reality of equal love in the digital realm \u00a0 | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini What do you look out for in the name of love? Self-love is majorly important. Professional sprinter Dutee Chand who came out has been vocal about self-love being a propellant for open honesty. But then what about love for the world? Tinder India\u2019s survey asked this question with the response being, \u201c70% of LGBTQ+ adults say it is important their date be involved in community issues. Outside of looks and personality, 51% say active involvement in LGBTQ+ organisations or causes is important to them.\u201d Anil Kumar, known for his work with Queer Campus Hyderabad, agrees. \u201cTinder, Grindr, PlanetRomeo and Instagram have become major pathways for LGBQTIA+ people. That being said, the 70% statistic about community involvement is a plus. Anyone in the larger community should be clued in on the issues in our society. That connection is a plus, for anyone. That connection eventually leads to meaningful relationships. In future, the other person in that relationship can open up and feel secure enough to be honest as a result. But then, there are people in relationships of any kind who may not want community issues to be a part of their relationship. So it can vary.\u201dThe survey cites that of the 61% who say they formally came out, 37% reportedly proclaimed their identity via social media. \u201cMen were more likely than women to come out via social media (42% compared to 28%, respectively),\u201d concludes Tinder India. Market research analyst Anjali Gangadhar* from Hyderabad says, \u201cYears ago, I took the Kinsey scale (also known as the Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale) and I found I was a 2, which implied I have an attraction to women. I was actually one of the first users of Tinder when it came to India. Since then, the number of fake profiles have gone down. Girls and guys who look for girls to spice things up in the bedroom as a third party isn\u2019t what I\u2019m here for.\u201d Now that\u2019s something that should have been in the Tinder survey! Anjali shares she was in a relationship with someone for a year who eventually came out as bisexual and she helped spruce up his Tinder profile and meet new people too. For a digital platform, looks like things are pointing up if natural growth like this is happening!\n\n\n\n\n\nOur primary worry is safety; safety around our deeply personal information or our physical safety when matches lead to real-time meetings. One of those fears became a reality when Kolkata-based Tinder user Ananya matched with a girl named Alisha who claimed she was lesbian. But the conversation took an ugly turn when \u2018Alisha\u2019 revealed herself to be a straight cis man pretending to be a bisexual girl to out women \u201cfor fun,\u201d as he put it. He\u2019d even used a young girl\u2019s photo as the profile photo as part of his ruse. Ananya took to Twitter and shared the screenshots of her conversation and Tinder India instantly shut the account down. After all, the Internet is forever.However, Sanskriti Aggarwal*, a 29-year-old research scholar from Visakhapatnam who identifies herself as a lesbian, says, \u201cI am not sure if being behind the screen helps people in coming out, but it definitely gives them the power to fool around. There are too many fraud accounts. I was fooled twice on Tinder in Visakhapatnam. So genuinely, I did not find Tinder that good. I got off the app after using it for two months and moved on to other dating apps that felt more secure. There are apps in the market that allow you to put up qualities that you are looking for in your partner, and interests which the app matches with other individuals. This is much more helpful than blind swiping. Out of which a 98% match was with my current partner. We got in touch and it clicked! I am the happiest to have her in my life.\u201d* Names have been changed to protect identities(With inputs from Aishwarya Upadhye)You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nBen Stokes in Cricket 19 \u00a0 Whether you want soccer \u2014 football, if you\u2019re across the ocean \u2014 or basketball, there\u2019s always the FIFA or NBA series of games in which to dive in. Cricket, played across three continents, still has a very slim and linear representation in the video game space, and Cricket 19, formerly known as Ashes Cricket, hopes to bring that AAA cricket gaming experience to your living room. Cricket 19 \u2013 The Official Game of the AshesDeveloper + Publisher: Big Ant Studios Price: \u20b93999 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4What\u2019s it about? Despite sporting a simpler name, Cricket 19 is very much an Ashes game, focusing on the Test Series played between Australia and England. With in-depth men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams from different parts of the \u2018Land Down Under\u2019, you can participate in a Career Mode that spans across 20 years, as you create your player and throw your very own curveball to fame. Additionally, you can recreate famous matches from T20 and other world series, though you will need to wade through a lot of menus to do so. Once you\u2019re set up for the international matches, you can recreate famous games from any era. You can replay all the series of India vs Pakistan matches to change history, but be prepared for a lot of menu navigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Cricket 19 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it play? Everything works just right in Cricket 19, and while it lacks the glamour of a FIFA, the gameplay is top-notch. With well-thought-out mechanics for every role, be it a batsman, a bowler or any other choice of pitch-and-play position. The AI of the other players are also top-notch. While the pitches lack that excitement or spectacle, they are recreated from famous ones the world over. Everything about the game lacks polish, from the wooden animations to the passable graphics, even though the player models look great.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsman Khawaja in Cricket 19 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get it? If you\u2019re willing to overlook the fact that the only two licensed teams are Australia and England, as well as the lacklustre presentation, then Cricket 19 will happily fill that void the IPL left behind in your life. Still in Game of Thrones withdrawal? Then Total War: Three Kingdoms could be that fix for treachery and battle that you crave. Except, instead of being a passive observer, you get to lead your forces into battle, recreating one of the greatest historical masterpieces ever written.\n\n\n\n\n\nJonny Bairstow in Cricket 19\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it about? Set in ancient China, Total War follows the events of the book Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which took place during 220 to 280 AD, at the end of the Han dynasty and the start of the Jin dynasty. You get to choose between one of the 12 factions and carve your own path through history to claim your seat as emperor. Three Kingdoms is an excellent tactical game that condenses a thick history into a surprisingly fun and engaging experience, especially when played in the mythical Romance mode.Total War: Three KingdomsDeveloper: Creative AssemblyPublisher: SegaPrice: \u20b91999 for PCHow does it play? Your generals are superpower-wielding heroes who ride into battle with an impressive arsenal of special moves that take out large numbers of enemy soldiers, adding a bit of the supernatural to the game. Playing in Romance mode adds that extra oomph to this turn-based tactical strategy game. If it\u2019s historical accuracy you are after, then you can play in Records mode, but be warned things do get slow and boring there.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just about devising strategies on when to send in the cavalry; you will need to recruit the best to your cause, from any field. Politics and diplomacy also play a healthy part, as you not only have to appease your best, but you also need to make alliances or even back-stab those in your path.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get it? If you love the idea of an epic strategy action game, with exciting, edge-of-the-seat battles and a massive world to conquer and unify, then Total War: Three Kingdoms delivers.

      "\n\nWhy a Samsung 8K QLED TV is better than a partner\n\n",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/why-a-samsung-8k-qled-tv-is-better-than-a-partner/article27525880.ece",
      "\nThe new Samsung QLED 8K TV \u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  The average person today spends hours staring into their monitors, screens and phones, binging on Netflix and other such. This is not even a gender-specific trait, rather, a general infliction across our species. I was recently privy to the launch of Samsung\u2019s revolutionary new range of TVs, screens that were massive enough to replace load-bearing walls at homes, and yet, no thicker than an oil painting! Like any gadget-crazed freak should do, I immediately weighed in on just what I would have to sacrifice to own one of these. As it turned out, the compromise wasn\u2019t all that hard to succumb to. Here then, is my rather androgynous reasoning for why investing in one of these mega-screens is better than coupling up.The price you\u2019ll pay 75 inch (163 cm) at \u20b910,99,900 82 inch (207 cm) at \u20b916,99,900 98 inch (247 cm) at \u20b959,99,900 (Made to order only)8K Resolution: A thing of beauty is only a joy forever if it keeps evolving to stay in sync with your current desires. Nothing static can stay pure; not even water. While the reason you fell in love might fade, owning a flat screen that throws back impossibly immersive imagery day after day is not one to fall out of love of any time soon. AI Chip: Any form of intelligence that your partner displayed during courtship will soon be replaced with a sense of complacency brought about due to comfort. Well, not so much with these QLEDs, because no matter the input provided, these sensors (artificial) intelligently manage to upscale it to 8K resolution, which is basically an enhancement almost 64 times over regular full-HD. As U2 sang, \u201cEven better than the real thing\u201d indeed.One Connect Box: One trouble with relationships is all the connections one has endure and honour \u2014 dinners at jaded uncles and aunts, annoying cousins, pestering nieces and nephews, the never-ending saga of the family black sheep who just can\u2019t seem to hold down a job\u2026Well, the Samsung 8K QLED connects with just one wire to the Invisible Box which then takes in all the connections, dongles, gaming devices satellites, and other connections you can throw at it. It has more ports than the entire coastal India and can smoothly direct all incoming network traffic. A case in point for multi-tasking which is yet another desirable but deficient skill in most partners we\u2019ll find.One Remote: Voice-activated and intuitively intelligent, it\u2019s a lot more than one can expect from the person you chose to annoy you for the rest of your life.Bixby: Communication is the reason why most twosomes (or threesomes) break down. In today\u2019s tech world, that translates to speaking Android to an iOS device. Thankfully, Samsung\u2019s inherent operating environment ensures that no matter what platform you\u2019re coming off, it understands you and allows you to meaningfully connect with your ultra-display. Coincidentally, meaningful connections is exactly what my therapist tells me I really need to work at.Costs: The new QLEDs are definitely not cheap, but neither is an Indian wedding. At least you can have these ultra-premium TVs financed. They won\u2019t fall behind the times for the next decade, which is more than one can say for most folks. With 16 models (across 4K and 8K) and multiple sizes to go for (starting at 43\u201d and all the way up to a custom-made 98\u201d) one has enough to choose and subsequently, upgrade. TVs don\u2019t mind that, or when you come home with half an episode already streamed on your iPad and then watch the rest on the home screen.Ambient Mode: The thing about many a partner is that they don\u2019t understand personal space and don\u2019t accord it often or enough. An ambient mode TV, the kind which blends into the background like, say the wall, on which it is flush-fitted, is the least intrusive piece of art you will ever hang at home. It\u2019s there, and yet, isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the luxury of omnipresence at its most refined.So, as with relationships, the question lurks: should one or shouldn\u2019t one take the plunge with the 8K? Well, the doubt that most people will have is whether it truly manages to upgrade the content to 8K resolution or will one be stuck with a very expensive device and blurry images? From what I saw, I feel the AI is powerfully reliable and the upscales beautifully so. The price may be a deterrent, especially given how fast the tech world evolves, but for the moment this seems future-safe, and won\u2019t go redundant while your EMIs are still fresh.And in case you feel that 8K is too far a jump to make, given that the industry is still struggling to churn out 2K content, never mind the sluggish internet speeds that India currently \u201cboasts\u201d, the 4K is a good middle of the road \u2014 sensible \u2014 approach. The AI sensor upscales data here as well, and you might feel it\u2019s less of a leap of faith to make. But 4K or 8K, these aren\u2019t specs you need: it\u2019s stuff you want. In which case, leave logic out of the final inner debate. You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Google on June 5 celebrated the birth anniversary Elena Cornaro Piscopia, the first woman to earn a Ph.D, with a doodle.Born in 17th century Venice to a nobleman and his mistress, Piscopia was a prodigy. She was a polyglot \u2014 being proficient in Latin, Greek, French and Spanish by the age of seven. She later mastered Hebrew and Arabic. She could skillfully play the harp and the violin.As she grew older, her interests expanded to physics and astronomy. In 1669, she translated the \u2018Colloquy of Christ\u2019 from Spanish to Italian. The bishop of Padua, when he learned that Picsopia was pursuing a degree in theology, refused to award her a Ph.D on the grounds that she was a woman. She did, however get her degree in philosophy. \u201cHer oral examination in 1678 attracted so much interest that the ceremony had to be moved from the university to Padua Cathedral to accommodate an audience that included professors, students, senators, and invited guests from Universities all over Italy,\u201d says the Google doodle blog.This doodle, created by California-based illustrator Alyssa Winans, was inspired by Piscopia\u2019s \u201csingle-minded dedication to her studies but also by the sheer enjoyment she felt at the prospect of quiet study\u201d. In a short interview on the blog, the artist said it\u2019s vital to highlight the accomplishments of women in academia. \u201cI think it\u2019s vital, not only to inspire students of today to recognize what they can accomplish but also to paint an accurate portrait of women\u2019s contributions throughout history.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\u201cWe\u2019re all strangers in an unknown city, yet pretending like we own it and hoping for something better, which at its very best can be called Utopic,\u201d writes Anubhav Chakraborty in a Facebook post. He\u2019s the chief producer of the web documentary Latent Dreams: Tales of Daily Wage Migrant Workers in Delhi. Anubhav, who hails from Bengal, is a post-graduate student of Convergent Journalism, at Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi.This multimedia-interactive project, developed by a group in the college, as a part of their curriculum, is based on the lives of daily-wage migrant labourers, who can be spotted at numerous \u2018labour chowks\u2019 in Delhi. The aim was to \u201cattempt to build channels of emotional empathy between the city and its workers\u201d reads an introductory note on the website, where the content resides.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe work comprises edited documentary footage in a series of nine parts; an audio profile of a labourer reading aloud a letter he\u2019s writing to his mother; a section that features photographs clicked by two daily-wage labourers; articles around the lives of the communities involved; and a photo essay. This makes it a 360\u00b0 experience.A term coined by Professor Sandra Gaudenzi, at the London College of Media, i-Docs refers to interactive documentaries. She is a co-founder of the i-Docs Project (i-docs.org), a community of practitioners, researchers, students and enthusiasts.There are three levels of interactivity that determine the type of documentary: semi-closed (the user can browse but not change the content), semi-open (the user can participate but not change the structure of the interactive documentary), completely open (the user and the interactive documentary constantly change and adapt to each other).Anubhav\u2019s documentary Latent Dreams falls into the first category (semi-closed). Prison Valley (2009), a web documentary by French journalist David Dufresne and Journey to the End of Coal (2008) about the lives of Chinese migrant workers, both fall under the \u2018semi-open\u2019 interactive category. There are interesting experiments around the third type: the remake of the classic 1929 documentary Man With a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov invited people from around the globe to interpret original scenes and upload their videos to the site. Today, a new version of the film is built every day.The cameras (both still and moving), and sometimes a pen, follow the lives of three labourers, as they go about life, singing, creating poetry, sometimes taking on politicians at a community gathering. The idea is to tap into the personal, to get a glimpse of how the \u2018new\u2019 urban landscape, employers, and people around affect the migrant.Inspired by the interactive multimedia project Puerto Rico by The Washington Post, Anubhav stresses on the need for more interactive content: \u201cThe unification of multiple mediums (audio, visual, text) is important, so that a large section of people can understand the story better.\u201dThe main challenge in creating such content is to bring technology and journalism together, for tech specialists like coders and VR specialists to get involved with documentary journalists and scholars.Ironically Shankar Rai, one of the two labourers featured in the documentary, hasn\u2019t seen the project yet. He doesn\u2019t know what a web documentary is, and though the film is available online, he has no hope of going online. He asks for a CD that he can keep just in case he\u2019d like to watch it some day. He couldn\u2019t make it to the first screening in college, but, \u201cIf the documentary is screened anywhere now, I\u2019ll make sure to bring my family along.\u201dIn 2010, Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a, an American journalist, pioneered the concept of immersive journalism. In 2014, the World Economic Forum included her Project Syria about a bomb explosion in a Syrian town. "

      "\nToday\u2019s Google Doodle celebrates the pride month celebrated in June every year commemorating the beginning of LGBTQI+ movement in New York in 1969\n\u00a0 Marking 50 years in the struggle for acceptance of LGBTQI+ rights, today\u2019s Google doodle is dedicated to the pride history which is celebrated in the month of June every year. Designed by Nate Swinehart, the doodle commemorates different stages of pride activism with 3D graphics and an amalgam of colors that have come to symbolize the movement over five decades.The fight for LGBTQI+ rights began in New York on June 28, 1969 when the police raided Stonewall Inn, a bar that was popular with the community. Police raids on such bars was a common practice in those days, but things took a turn when instead of buckling, a group of young individuals protested against the raids, in a rebellion that lasted for five days. The Stonewall protests motioned a decades-long struggle for the acceptance of queer identities. From the first rainbow flag being hoisted in San Francisco in 1978 to AIDS being recognized as a medical disease in 1982 after being referred to as \u2018gay fever\u2019 for years, the movement has come a long way.In India, the idea of acceptance of queer identities and same-sex marriage was finally realized in September last year, when the Supreme Court after a slew of petitions unanimously decriminalised Section 377, citing it as an \u2018infringement on the fundamental rights of autonomy, intimacy and identity.\u201dNonetheless, the movement still has a long way to go with only 28 out of 167 countries having legalised same sex marriage so far, and only 52 countries providing legal protection against discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nAll you need to know about app-based apartment security systems\n\n",
      "Updated: June 4, 2019 12:55 IST\rPublished: June 4, 2019 10:22 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-app-based-apartment-security-systems/article27433331.ece",
      "It\u2019s unreasonable to expect the security guard to recognise who is the owner every time. What if you got a hair cut? After all, he doesn\u2019t have a face recognition technology (yet). Jokes aside, with the boom in e-commerce, online cab and food deliveries, the footfall in gated communities has increased drastically, which has led to avoidable delays at the entrance. Technologies like MyGate, ADDA GateKeeper and ApnaComplex understand these challenges and offer end-to-end app-based apartment security and management solutions.On May 31, MyGate announced a partnership with multiple e-commerce brands, including Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo and Grofers. Once the user selects auto-approval for trusted brands, the delivery executive needs to just share his phone number with the guard before reaching your doorstep. Vijay Arisetty, co-founder and CEO, MyGate, says, \u201cWe take the existing online footprint and improve the user experience for online services and offline processes for residents in gated communities.\u201d It\u2019s worth mentioning that these platforms are ad-free and the makers claim it will remain so.Once the management of a gated community decides to get the services, they are added in the database of the platform. This involves creating profiles (name, address, phone number etc) of residents; security guards; and frequent visitors like gardeners, baby sitters, domestic help, drivers and tutors. The guards are given a smartphone to interact with the residents to verify the visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nA security guard verifies a vistor using MyGate at the Paramount Towers, Visakhapatnam\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese apps allow one-time password verification of visitors, tracking vehicles which are parked incorrectly, monitoring when the domestic help and others reach the premises, and making payments like maintenance fee and salaries to helping staff. Each month, you will know exactly how many days your staff was absent without any arguments. Now, who wouldn\u2019t want that feature?With this technology, visitors\u2019 log is no longer just a formality. But the tech is not limited to security solutions. The tech is especially useful for the management of gated communities. It helps them in reducing paperwork drastically, by making digital workflows like build portals to inform the residents, pre-booking amenities, and most importantly, taking feedback effectively. Recently, the welfare association of Paramount Towers in Visakhapatnam subscribed to MyGate. P Vijay Krishna, treasurer of Paramount Towers Welfare Association, says, \u201cThis technology is certainly the need of the hour. We no longer rely on manual recording processes. As a result, information is just a few clicks away.\u201dThe users can make in-app calls to other residents and the security guard. If the gated communities integrate this technology from the beginning, they can avoid spending lakhs on intercoms, a yesteryear\u2019s technology which involves maintenance cost.While these features make sure community management can get their heads over the paperwork and focus on getting things done, the fact remains technology is only as good as its operator. Community management can pick and choose the feature they need. If your gated community decides to opt for it, make sure it begins with a few features and then gradually integrates other processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks flows can customised as per clients requirements\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, if the technology is making a simple process complicated, then it\u2019s best skipped. For instance, if giving food to your domestic help, the app-enabled households need to click a picture and send a message to the guard. Just leave it to technology for taking the joy out of little acts of kindness. But in many gated communities, security guards have to check the items taken out by the maid. Amit Kumar Tyagi, chief business officer at ApnaComplex, says, \u201cSome people actually prefer this system, since they don\u2019t want the guard crossing-checking via phone each time.\u201dIf Black Mirror episodes got to you and you don\u2019t need the hi-tech lifestyle, these technologies might seem like a fad. On the other hand, those who feel prevention is better than cure and welcome futuristic solutions will embrace these platforms.Byte-sized play-by-plays of tech conceptsYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nGoogle Pixel 3a XL, the ultimate dark horse\n\n",
      "Updated: June 3, 2019 15:39 IST\rPublished: June 3, 2019 15:38 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-google-pixel-3a-xl-the-ultimate-dark-horse/article27413322.ece",
      "If you were one of the people who were up past midnight \u2014 like me \u2014 tuning into the Google I/O livestream on May 7, you saw the tech giant throw plenty of shade at their competitors (easy to interpret from their side-by-side shots with a poorly named \u2018Phone X\u2019) as they explained the superiority of their latest smartphone, the Pixel 3a series.The hype leading up to its release was so widespread and lasted so long, it was as though the Android world let out a sigh of relief when the phone finally launched. Am I salty? Maybe.So when I finally held the light yet sturdy Pixel 3a XL, it took a moment to adjust to the larger size \u2014 but not too long due to the well-designed ergonomic unibody and the familiar two-tone design all Pixel phones have come to love.Google Pixel 3a XL SpecsBody type: PolycarbonateDimensions: 160.10 x 76.10 x 8.20 mmWeight: 167gBattery capacity: 3700 mAhResolution: 1080x2160 pixelsProtection type: Asahi DragonTrailProcessor: 1.7GHz octa-core (4x2.1GHz + 4x1.7GHz) Processor make: Qualcomm Snapdragon 670RAM and Internal storage: 4GB, 64GBRear camera: 12.2-megapixel (f/1.8, 1.4-micron)Rear autofocus: Phase detection autofocusFront camera: 8-megapixel (f/2.0)Sensors: Fingerprint sensor, Compass/Magnetometer, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Ambient light sensor, Gyroscope, BarometerThe Pixel 3 sets you back around \u20b950,000, the price being the indicator that the 3 is juiced with all things \u2018bigger and better\u2019. It\u2019s natural to compare the 3a and 3a XL with the 3 \u2014 and the first thing you\u2019ll notice is the polycarbonate unibody for the 3a and 3a XL, while the 3 is sleek with its soft-touch, yet even sturdier, glass body made of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The fingerprint sensor for the 3a and 3a XL is more recessed, probably owing to the material of the body casing.Plus, we totally need a moment of silence for the headphone jack port along the top of the device. Thinking back to the talk at Google I/O, the announcement of this feature was met with delightful applause.The display is dazzling; clean lines, colours which are not too saturated to a point of nausea, seamless gradients and more\u2026 they\u2019re all part of Google Pixel\u2019s new \u2018Adaptive\u2019 mode, which is designed to provide a vivid yet natural rendition of colours that most users prefer. With more devices being turned down for investment simply because of a harsh display, Google have ensured that this device isn\u2019t one to slip through the cracks.But fear not, if you\u2019re into muted colours, there are two additional optional modes which have been thankfully retained: \u2018Natural\u2019 (sRGB) and \u2018Boosted\u2019 (sRGB + 10%) which can be found in Settings.And the camera is to match. Initially, I wasn\u2019t blown away, but with plenty of meddling, I grew to love this camera as much as my DSLR, if not more because of its portability. Plus, shooting video on the 3a and 3a XL is a dream, thanks to the Fused Video Stabilisation feature, giving it that almost-GoPro Hero 7 feel.Suggest to anyone looking for a life-altering smartphone camera and many will be quick to suggest a Pixel phone. But with the 3a and 3a XL being the toned-down version of the 3, the camera of the 3 is just in a higher class. Some of the normal shots on the 3a and 3a XL will be marginally grainier\u2026 but that\u2019s part of the compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I\u2019m probably going to make some enemies here, but the Portrait Mode on Pixel phones is far superior to the iPhone lot. Here\u2019s why: with the Depth Effect feature in iPhone\u2019s Portrait Mode, the composition is essentially marred, the lines around the subject in focus becoming blurry, thus making the final image a little disappointing. Working with the Portrait Mode on the Pixel is just a seamless experience. Facts.Out for the night and want to capture that dreamy ambient mood? The Night Sight, again met with excitement at Google I/O, has your back. Pixel\u2019s low-light camera mode, works by using software instead of hardware like flash or tripods, to capture vibrant and detailed low-light photos. Google claims to have integrated state-of-the-art techniques in computational photography and Machine Learning, thus making Night Sight an adaptation to you and the environment, so you can capture stunning photos you otherwise would have missed in the dark.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd who says the Pixel lot have to be super serious? Playground, much like its name, is all for some fun for your camera. If you\u2019re experiencing Pokemon Go withdrawal, Playground lets you spruce up the world around you; simply insert a Playmoji into your pictures and videos \u2014 from Marvel\u2019s Avengers characters to cutesy 3D weather avatars.So has Google Lens been upped? Well, Pixel 3a and 3a XL feature a much tighter integration with Google Lens, packed with new functionality. The recognition of peripheral objects and texts is so seamless, you can consider shutting your eyes for the day\u2026 but no Bird Box Challenge, please.Digital well-being is one of the biggest buzzwords this decade, but Google has turned it into a feature on their phones\u2026 plus App Timers and a Wind Down mode, which I used to my heart\u2019s (and mind\u2019s) content. A digital Do Not Disturb on your hotel room door, it lets you refocus and meet those pesky \u2014 I mean, needed \u2014 deadlines.So don\u2019t worry, you still have the intuitive Assistant and the Adaptive Battery to seal the deal of that autonomous experience. And the Fast Charging set you off for a 7-hour usage, and a decent 3 hours if you\u2019re gaming. So at that \u20b940,000 average pricing, one cannot call this a budget phone by any means, not when competitors have somewhat similar phones racking up next to the 3a and 3a XL. But the brand-lovers out there will justify that you\u2019re forking over the extra cash for the Google brand and experience, and the freedom to use the hashtag #teampixel without looking like a proper dolt.You know that feeling when you really don\u2019t want to like something but the tech-o-phile in you whispers, \u2018come on, you know this phone has stolen your heart.\u2019 Yep, that\u2019s what happened here.The 5.6-inch Pixel 3a is priced at \u20b939,999 and the 6-inch Pixel 3a XL is \u20b944,999.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The comments which followed ensured the hilarious turn of events. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one day, Twitterati seem to have made me more famous than Modi, says Vadivelu on Neasamani memes\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn one day, Twitterati seem to have made me more famous than Modi, says Vadivelu on Neasamani memes\nOne of the users, Vignesh Prabhakar replied it was called \u2018Suthiyal\u2019 in Tamil and went on to refer to a famous character portrayed by Vadivelu in the 2001 Tamil film Friends, where the hammer falls on the actor\u2019s head and he falls unconscious. He plays the character of a building contractor supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the movie, Vadivelu\u2019s character \u2018Neasamani\u2019 often falls victim to to his employees (\u2019apprentices\u2019) antics. Mr. Prabhakar referred to Neasamani\u2019s character without explaining the context, leading to some users believing that the hammer fell on a real person\u2019s head. This spawned a number of hilarious comments as Vadivelu fans began commenting on the series of comical incidents that happens with Neasamani in the movie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Replying to the comment made by Mr. Prabhakar, one FB user replied that he will pray for Neasamani. \u201cTell them all to take care of him\u201d, he said unaware of the side-splitting tweets that was to ensue. As screenshots began doing the rounds, #pray_for_Neasamani started trending on Twitter on Wednesday evening.By Thursday morning, the tweets #pray_for_Neasamani was trending on top across India and at No.6 worldwide, while another #Nesamani was trending at No. 3 worldwide, after the comedian\u2019s fans unleashed memes and made references to many of Vadivelu\u2019s film scenes.\u00a0Former Indian spinner, Harbhajan Singh, who plays for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, picked out a scene of Vadivelu wearing a yellow turban and said the incident wouldn\u2019t have happened if only the comedian had worn the yellow turban at that time. Chennai Super Kings, meanwhile tweeted a picture of Dhoni, with the message \u2018The only man who could\u2019ve saved Contractor Nesamani with his epic reaction time in now in England!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Twitterati also began making up their own stories relating the scene to many of Tamil Nadu\u2019s recent political developments, including that of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa\u2019s hospitalisation at Apollo Hospitals, and the statements many of her partymen made at that time regarding her health condition. They also used \u2018Neasamani\u2019s situation\u2019 to poke fun at some political leaders. Many fans also asked for a CBI inquiry into the \u2018incident\u2019 of the falling hammer and the setting up of an enquiry commission.Not all was just fun though. A police officer made use of the hashtag to advise citizens to wear a helmet while riding a bike and ensure their safety, while a paint company decided to market its services claiming that the company\u2019s painters were more professionally qualified than the character who drops the hammer on Neasamani\u2019s head. Some also used a picture of Vadivelu visiting a police station in a film, to ask for the tracing of missing activist Mugilan.Ironically, someone tried to make use of the hashtag by asking people to donate to a bank account, before another Twitter user called it out as fake.On Thursday morning, as the trend picked up worldwide traction, many fans changed their Twitter prefix with \u2018Contractor\u2019, just the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his party cadre, and his supporters prefixed \u2018Chowkidaar\u2019 before their Twitter names during the elections.Vadivelu is now being seen very rarely on screen leaving millions of his fans disappointed at his rather minimal screen presence, and often refer to his dialogues in various real life situations, and on social media.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

File\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Apple on May 28 introduced its first new iPod model in four years, highlighting music and games as it continued to make a priority of serving up digital content.The new-generation iPod touch, essentially an iPhone without the phone calls, was available in more than two dozen countries at Apple's online shop starting at $199.\u201cWe're making the most affordable iOS device even better with performance that is twice as fast as before, Group FaceTime and augmented reality,\u201d said Apple vice president of product marketing Greg Joswiak. \u201cThe ultra-thin and lightweight design of iPod touch has always made it ideal for enjoying games, music and so much more wherever you go.\u201dThe iPod touch evolved from the original iPod digital music player first launched by Apple in 2001. The iPod touch became popular with people, particularly parents of internet-coveting children, who wanted mobile devices for getting online without the cost of telecommunications services. The mobile devices can connect to the internet using Wi-Fi hotspots.Apple earlier this year unveiled streaming video plans along with news and game subscription offerings as part of an effort to shift its focus to digital content and services to break free of its reliance on iPhone sales.An Apple TV+ service, an on-demand, ad-free subscription service, will launch this year in 100 countries, the company said.Apple News+ was launched in the US and Canada in English and French and will be available later this year in Britain and Australia, the company said.Separately, the company said it was launching a new game subscription service called Apple Arcade later this year with at least 100 titles at launch.\u201ciOS is the world's largest gaming platform, and with three times faster graphics, games on the new iPod touch run even smoother and look even more beautiful,\u201d Apple said in a release.The first new iPod since the year 2015 comes as Apple shifts to emphasize digital content and other services to offset a pullback in the once-sizzling smartphone market, and with many news organizations struggling to monetize their online services.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The pictures are a total riot! The cringe-worthy posts show people making the most of long-haul flights to get so settled in, it\u2019s uncomfortable for everyone else. Whether they\u2019re making the already tight aisles into their personal yoga studio or the armrest of the seat in front of them a footrest, these posts are the kind that you can\u2019t unsee but also can\u2019t look away from.

Invited to compete in an international racing tournament by a mysterious alien raccoon called Dodon Pa, Sonic and gang reluctantly accept, mostly lured by the premise of riding in some really rad souped-up cars. However, there is something suspicious about Dodon Pa, and the team have to get to the finish line while finding out what Dodon Pa is up to.Team Sonic Racing Developer: Sumo DigitalPublisher: SegaPrice: \u20b92000 (approx) each for Nintendo SwitchRefreshingly, Team Sonic Racing has a story mode that is mostly a loose collection of races tied together by a thin narrative and it does tell an entertaining story, with a whole lot of fan service, while giving you a chance to try out different characters in racing. How does it play? One thing is for certain: the cars look incredible here, with characters and their rides matching up in colour and their personality. Sonic has always been about speed and these rides scream both speed and power. At the first few glances, the game looks like an asset-swapped Mario Kart. From the levels to the attacks you can use against other racers. It\u2019s when Sonic Racing starts moving, that it feels like a faster Mario Kart.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap of Team Sonic Racing\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith some mind-bending, colourful levels and nifty mechanics, like using your opponent\u2019s slipstream to catapult you further. Where Mario Kart is delightful and quirky, Sonic Racing is shiny, bold and fast \u2014 though decidedly lacking in the spark, it is still fun. Plus, it\u2019s available on consoles that Mario Kart is not on.Should you get it? A Mario Kart-beater it is not, but Sonic Team Racing is a fun and fast game with incredible loopy de loop tracks and some colourful hot rod cars with a wonderful SEGA arcade-y feel.Hot on the heels of Resident Evil 2 Remake\u2019s (RE2R) success, Capcom has launched not one but three classic Resident Evil games. The prequel Resident Evil 0 (RE0), the original Resident Evil (RE1) as well as the action-y Resident Evil 4 (RE4) all get the remastered treatment, which you can take on-the-go on your Nintendo Switch. Resident Evil 0, 1 and 4Developer + Publisher: CapcomPrice: \u20b92,499 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo SwitchWhat\u2019s it about? There are three things which make a good Resident Evil game \u2014 the terrifying environments, the survival factor and the people twisted by the zombie viruses. You begin where the franchise starts off \u2014 deep in the Arklay mountains, as you explore a mysterious mansion in RE1 and a train-wreck in RE0, to unearth a mystery involving government experiments and bio warfare. Resident Evil 4 was a different beast altogether, set in a rural village dominated by a cult infected with a mind-controlled virus. You experience a turning point in the franchise as it evolves into a narrative-driven survival action game.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Resident Evil games\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it play? The HD Remasters of RE1 and RE0 are a sight to behold, as these games are transformed with updated visuals and textures. As you scrounge for ammo and survive against mutating monsters with environments full of jump scares. Both experienced through a fixed camera angle, which may seem a bit dated.RE4 drops the fixed camera for a familiar third-person-over-the-shoulder aim system that is most accessible to users in this Fortnite-powered realm. With an incredible story backing it up, RE4 was less horror and more explosive with some fantastic enemies that were truly gory, and a cult that would make you scream.Should you get it? While RE4 is an easy game to recommend to today\u2019s players, RE1 and RE0 would be best appreciated by nostalgic fans who missed out on these games in the late 90s early 00s."

      "\u201cThe Big Bang, a moment when a tiny speck of energy expanded, giving birth to space and time,\u201d says the sonorous-sounding Tilda Swinton right into my earphones. How did the universe come about? She explains, in an Augmented Reality-powered app that lets you hold planets in your palms. Google Arts & Culture, the platform which exhibits an eclectic variety of classic works in the field of visual arts, has unveiled \u2018Once Upon a Try\u2019. Google worked with over 110 renowned institutions across 23 countries to digitise over 400 interactive collections as part of this exhibition. Scroll and StrollNASA\u2019s Visual Universe: Explore NASA\u2019s archive of 127,000 historic photographs, driven by Google Machine Learning.CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider: The largest machine on the planet, through Street View.Travel through India\u2019s outdoor astronomical observatory, the Jantar Mantar, through Street View.Shrink down to the size of an atom to discover the latest advances in nano and biotechnology \u2014 in augmented reality, with the Deutsches Museum (DE)Brush up on your astrophysics in Virtual Reality with a selection of museums from around the globe through the Google Expeditions app.These institutions don the garb of the curators, while Google provides the technology platform that allows the material to be uploaded, managed, and exhibited online. The framework for the exhibit, as expected by the institutes, is also devised by the tech giant.This is a treasure trove, comprising not just art, but also inventions and discoveries curated in collaboration with CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), NASA and 100 other institutes and museums from around the globe. Once Upon A Try is possibly the largest freely-accessible collection of information highlighting important-yet-undiscovered creations in science. And one can explore this immensity from the comfort of their screens.One rivetting exhibit is \u2018Testing the Limits of Gunpowder\u2019, a documentary exploring contemporary artist of Chinese origin, Cai Guo-Qiang and the ways in which he redefines gunpowder as a medium. For this project, he studies Da Vinci\u2019s works and incorporates gunpowder into his existing works.There is more than what meets the eye in this carefully-curated labyrinth. To find scientific concepts in the form of displays amid visual arts, is rare. But what exactly led to the inception of this project?\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon Rein, program manager, Google Arts & Culture\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMany of the cultural institutions we engage with, have amazing scientific collections. And there are so many artefacts through which you can learn about the tools that we take for granted, never realising that someone, somewhere thought about creating it,\u201d Simon Rein, program manager, Google Arts & Culture writes. \u201cWe thought it would be fascinating to uncover this and maybe even inspire people to become creators themselves.\u201dBut a project of this scale, is not devoid of challenges. \u201cWhen you digitise art and culture, you still have a way to go to capture its meaning and significance and tell stories about them to a global audience.\u201d \u201cPeople love experiencing artwork in close detail,\u201d says Simon. Which is why \u2018Once Upon a Try\u2019 is generously peppered with applications that make the art seem easily available to the browser. Simon continues, \u201cWe use 360\u00ba panoramic imagery, which can be easily adapted into virtual reality exhibitions that can be viewed using your phone and Google Cardboard.\u201d Google Cardboard is the affordable and foldable VR headset made of cardboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 360\u00b0 Augmented Reality app for The Big Bang exhibit\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have also developed a high resolution \u2018Art Camera\u2019 which can capture \u2018gigapixel\u2019 images of 2-D artefacts. A gigapixel image is made of over one billion pixels and can bring out details invisible to the naked eye. Using laser and sonar to aid focusing, the Art Camera takes hundreds of close-up images that are then stitched together to create an intensely detailed whole. With the Big Bang exhibit, one can witness the birth of the universe in the palm of your hand, and experience its evolution right up to today in 360\u00b0 Augmented Reality. This new AR app has been developed in collaboration with particle physicists from CERN. One can also join NASA astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Charles Bolden in Virtual Reality, as they revisit the space shuttle Discovery and their mission to launch the Hubble space telescope into the orbit. We are not alien to prolific scientific inventions. Google feels the same way; in the platform, one can revisit the story of the first electronic computer developed in India, and join the journey of chess becoming a global game, learn about Ayurveda, and explore India\u2019s contribution to medicine. The multimedia exhibits also provide an insight into the life of innovators like Professor Govind Swarup, a pioneer of radio astronomy, and Chewang Norphel, who creates artificial glaciers in Ladakh to combat climate change. With institutes like Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and Hyderabad\u2019s Salar Jung Museum joining hands, the platform garners attention to the lesser-known discoveries from India \u2014 and this is where Professor Govind comes into play.\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the India curation within \u2018Once Upon A Try\u2019\n\u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nspecial arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe exhibits track the radiophysics group of TIFR for the last 55 years. Govind Swarup had set up a small telescope in Kalyan, which used old radio dishes donated by Australia. He started looking for a site close to the equator for setting up a bigger telescope. The appropriate site was found in Ooty. It was constructed between 1966 and 1970. This telescope led to many discoveries,\u201d explains Yogesh Wadadekar, of National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Tata Institute for Fundamental Research. This eventually led to the idea of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), which was constructed from 1988 to 2000 about 80 kms north of Pune. In 2002, it was released as an international open access facility and has been running so, for the past 16 years. A movie documenting the ideating of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) process, and an exhibit showing the life and work of Professor Swarup using archival pictures and text, and video stories on the buildings of the Ooty Radio Telescope and the GMRT, are what NCRA-TIFR was created in collaboration with Google. \n\n\n\n\n\nHas Google faced any criticism for making iconic works easily available? Museums in India and in fact around the globe are implementing digital models as part of their strategies to preserve and promote their collection and our cultural heritage. Simon says, \u201cAbout five to six years ago, the discussion was: should a museum go online and share its collection? Today the question is, \u2018what is the best way to do it?\u2019\u201dThe use of mobile devices strapped with Internet, he says, has become a priority, and is higher than on desktop devices. Sometimes museums don\u2019t have enough space to show their vast content, and this platform allows them to overcome this by putting up collections from their storage online. \u201cThat way, not only the users but other institutions also get to know of the hidden treasures and can contact them for further research and possible collaborations,\u201d Simon concludes.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nFILE PHOTO: An Electronic Arts (EA) video game logo is seen at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, in Los Angeles, California, United States\n\u00a0 You know the hype around India\u2019s gaming industry is real when gaming companies like Electronic Arts Inc (EA) and Rockstar Games make investments.  Recently, Dhruva Interactive (DI), the country\u2019s leading game production studio, was acquired by Rockstar Games. And e-xpress Interactive Software (eIS), a Mumbai-based video games distributor, signed an agreement with Electronic Arts for packaged goods. Rockstar Games\u2019 hits include the likes of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Red Dead Redemption series, while EA has popular role-playing games, sports titles and first-person shooter games like FIFA, Battelfield and Star Wars. What does it mean for gamers? Until now, new EA games were launched on e-commerce websites. After EA\u2019s deal with eIS, buying game CDs at offline retailers such as Sony Centre, Croma, Starmark and Landmark is expected to be way simpler. So don\u2019t be surprised when you see swarms of gaming enthusiasts outside stores for FIFA 20 later this year.Putting GTA V in contextGTA V has sold over 100 million copies since 2013.As of April 2018, it had made around $6 billion.Ranks third on most-selling games after Tetris and Minecraft.Can be played on Xbox, PlayStation and PC.Players still share GIFs and videos of their playthroughs.One question on the collective mind of India\u2019s gaming community after the Rockstar announcement is \u2018When can we expect GTA Mumbai?\u2019 as asked by user u/Flamewake on Reddit thread \u2018r/IndiaSpeaks\u2019. On the same thread, user u/Mad-o-wat jokes, \u201cI can imagine how many non-playable characters (like) rickshawallahs will get thrashed in GTA Mumbai.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot from GTA V by Rockstar Games\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThese events haven\u2019t gone viral on social media because it hasn\u2019t affected the consumers directly. But such deals have the potential to change the DNA of the gaming industry, feels Ankur Diwakar, a professional e-sports athlete. According to him, professional gamers often order games from global e-commerce platforms and don\u2019t mind paying a premium for early access. \u201cHowever, access to new games in retail stores is crucial for the next generation of gamers. Everything else, they can learn by practice and watching videos on YouTube,\u201d says Ankur, who represented India in Asian Games 2018.If gamers run the industry, game developers are its maker. It\u2019s no longer a wild fantasy to aspire for a career in the gaming industry in India. DI, the two-decade-old game developer, employs over 300 people. They were one of the art developers for games like Spider-Man, Days Gone, Forza Horizon 3, Halo 5 and Sea of Thieves. Now that they have the backing of an industry Goliath, DI has access to a better playing field with financial stability. This is not only good news for employees at DI, but also for people looking for opportunities at India\u2019s leading game developer. I won\u2019t be surprised if other global game developers follow Rockstar Games\u2019 footsteps.\n\n\n\n\n\nA still from the latest Spiderman Game by Insomniac Games, Dhruva Interactive were one of the art developers \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAs per a May 2017 study by KPMG and Google \u2018Online gaming in India: Reaching a new pinnacle\u2019, India\u2019s gaming industry is on track to reach US$ 1 billion by 2021. At the same time, gaming on consoles and PC is still limited to a niche segment in India.Did you know, most gaming PCs and consoles are sold at a higher price in India? Apart from the cost, there is fierce competition from hand-held devices, due to affordable pricing and development of high-end games like PUBG and FIFA. As per the study by KPMG and Google, the majority will continue to play on mobile devices in India. \n\n\n\n\n\nStill from one of the FIFA titles by EA\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, in near the future, hardware sales like in the US will hit the Indian market and catalyse growth supported by a widespread increase in the digital payment user base, affordability of new technologies, rise in India\u2019s developer base and focus on generating content with local themes, in Indian languages.Age is in your headUS-based Shirley Curry is the oldest gamer on YouTube, as per Guinness World Records.

      "The world\u2019s largest democracy has had its say. And it has been saying plenty through the General Elections, 2019, on the social network. As the BJP juggernaut bore down, netizens were quick to post and share politically flavoured memes. Game of Thrones and Avenger\u2019s End Game memes proliferated. People were quick to photoshop Modi\u2019s face on Thanos. Twitter user @sagarcasm drew similarities between GoT characters and Indian politicians. There were comparisons between Sansa Stark and Mamata Banerjee with the tweeter, Sagar, calling them leaders who got to rule the state but not the nation. Sagar\u2019s post got over 2,000 retweets and about 4,000 likes.The 2019 election stuck with the last election\u2019s winning tactic of using the social media. Platforms like Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all played their part in reaching out to the people. According to Facebook\u2019s Ad Library Report, over \u20b910 crore was spent on political ads between February and March 30, with a major chunk coming from BJP and its supportersMost of the political parties joined the meme wars ,mocking their opposition during the campaigning period. Not to be left behind, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting\u2019s Press Information Bureau rehashed dialogues from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Krrish and Border and through them urged people to vote. Mapping trendsAs per Trends24, Twitter\u2019s top trends on May 23 were #ElectionResultsFor2019, #Verdict2019, #ModiAaRahaHai and #ModiSweepVisakhapatnam-based businessman, Sunil Nevatia claims this time around there was even more political discussions between family and friends because of higher engagement on social media. There days when he receives more than 1000 memes a day! Sunil is a member in over 100 WhatsApp groups. \u201cThere is no way I can see all the memes. I go through a a fraction of them and forward the selected few,\u201d he adds. For some like Shivani Mirajkar, memes have been a source of information besides entertainment. \u201cI always considered politics boring until the memes came in. I find them hilarious. I came to know that Sunny Deol is contesting for elections from these memes and also was enlightened about Hema Malini\u2019s canvassing tactics! I keep myself updated on political news just to enjoy the context of these memes,\u201d she laughs. Shivani who is a 24-year-old classical singer says every time she comes across a funny meme, she shares it with friends. Ask her how many memes she shares in a day, \u201cThat would be an embarrassingly large number to state,\u201d she laughs. But the memes are not always in good humour as they often distort facts. Seventy-six-year-old Ishwar Prasad Khandelwal feels strongly about this. He complains, \u201cI think images and video circulated on Whatsapp get disproportionate attention. As a result, people don\u2019t do their research any more and get swayed with political propaganda.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nMeet Vue.AI, Chennai\u2019s fashion disruptors\n\n",
      "Updated: May 24, 2019 15:47 IST\rPublished: May 24, 2019 15:47 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/chennais-fashion-disruptors/article27235082.ece",
      "\nThe husband-and-wife founders of Vue.AI want to use AI to enhance the retail offerings of brands\n\u00a0 | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n Nearly two decades ago, Ashwini Asokan, then an undergraduate at MOP Vaishnav College in Chennai, believed that she was going to be a musician and dancer.But a long-distance relationship prompted her to follow her now-husband, Anand Chandrasekaran (a neuroscientist by training), to the United States, where she embarked on a career in design and product management with Intel. Cut to 2019, and the couple (pictured on the left) is back in Chennai with a start-up that\u2019s in the news for disrupting the world of fashion. Vue.ai \u2014 a retail automation platform that provides artificial intelligence-driven solutions to clients \u2014 announced late last month that it had raised $17 million of Series B funding, led by Falcon Edge Capital.Power of nowThe first vertical of parent company Mad Street Den, Vue.ai, was founded in 2016 after extensive research about the practical applications of artificial intelligence. \u201cFor us, the question was, \u2018Given how complex AI and computer vision is, what market is ripe for disruption now?\u2019\u201d shares Ashwini, who serves as CEO of Vue.ai.Fashion and retail seemed like the closest match, given how rapidly the industry was changing, thanks to the entry of behemoths like Alibaba and Amazon. Other developments included the advent of \u2018experiential retail\u2019, with the growth of immersive and entertainment-based experiences provided by brands. Then there was social media (especially Instagram) and its power of persuasion.\u201cStatus today is largely around experiences. So how does anybody make money in this world?\u201d asks Ashwini. Whether it\u2019s UK-based retailer Missguided with its pool party-themed lounge or furniture giant IKEA\u2019s \u2018sleepover at the store\u2019 event, brands who build experience into their retail offerings have an edge. \u201cShopping is going to change from being its own thing to becoming part of something bigger,\u201d predicts Ashwini. And Vue.ai wants to be a part of that process. Today, it boasts of big ticket clients from across the world, like American department store Macy\u2019s, Latin American e-commerce website Mercado Libre and Indian e-commerce company TataCliq. The solutions offered include automated merchandising, product tagging, an AI stylist, artificially generated models for clothing, and even personalised marketing to users based on how they interact with a retailer\u2019s platform.Grey matterAnand, also the CTO of the company, brings his experience in neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering to the table. \u201cI am on a neverending quest of trying to build brains and intelligence,\u201d he says. Artificial intelligence at Vue.ai works by bringing together complex subsystems and giving them practical applications. For instance, classification helps with tagging merchandise; generative networks help generate mannequins and models, and reinforcement learning helps provide personalised experiences and styling based on a user\u2019s behaviour. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use this as a way to build more complex subsystems, and in the process, make more money for Mad Street Den,\u201d laughs Anand.The company\u2019s value proposition is that it will save money, cost and resources so that clients can focus on providing wholesome, entertainment experiences. What results is a highly-personalised offering for users whose every behaviour is carefully analysed. \u201cOur algorithms are basically building your style profile and trying to match who you are and what you like at a pixel level,\u201d says Ashwini. Return journeyWalk into the office (pictured on the left) \u2014 a three storey home in Abhiramapuram \u2014 and you will see casually-dressed employees in an open concept space (Ashwini and Anand sit across from each other at a long table that they share with other colleagues). With at least 150 employees in the city \u2014 and around 10 in the US, among other locations \u2014 company culture is a priority. Children are welcome; there\u2019s even a nursery where they can play and hang out. Plus, the company\u2019s Indianness is worn proudly on its sleeve.That makes sense, given that the decision to set up shop here in 2014 (after an unsuccessful start in Bengaluru) was prompted largely by the couple\u2019s desire to return \u2018to Madras\u2019, and raise their two children in the city. Leaving California, shares Ashwini, was a result of the couple\u2019s desire to work on an idea that would combine their expertise (his in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and hers in product design and technology solutions). \u201cAI is clearly our expertise, and we are a tech-first company,\u201d explains Ashwini, adding that the labour pool was also a draw. \u201cThe deep tech talent in Chennai is unparalleled,\u201d she concludes.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\nSay no to motion smoothing on your HD TV\n\n",
      "Updated: May 22, 2019 14:50 IST\rPublished: May 22, 2019 14:50 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/say-not-to-motion-smoothing-on-your-hd-tv/article27205557.ece",
      "So, you are settled in front of your brand-new HD TV ready to re-watch that pivotal scene where Wonder Woman moves towards the enemy, dispensing bullets with a flick of her arm. The scene arrives but it doesn\u2019t look like a movie. Actually, it looks like a soap opera. The big-budget production has suddenly lost its expensive, \u2018film-like\u2019 quality and instead has a very real-life and cheap look.Wondering what on earth is going on? After all, if you have paid anywhere from \u20b950,000 to over \u20b91.5 lakh for your television, it is but reasonable to expect the best viewing experience. The answer is that the motion smoothing feature on your television is on. Okay, but you may ask what exactly motion smoothing is. Also known as motion interpolation, video interpolation, and the soap opera effect, it refers to a process of reducing motion blur by artificially inflating the frame rate of the film or series. So, from 24 frames per second (fps) it is increased to 60fps, 120fps or even higher (higher rates are perceived as motion), digitally combining the images to simulate more. This effect can be useful when watching sports, as the action moves quickly, and enabling the feature allows viewers to catch more details.However, now even well-known film directors and actors are becoming vocal against motion smoothing and urging people to turn it off on their televisions.In December last year, star Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie took to Twitter with a public service announcement . In it, the Mission Impossible: Fallout duo , tell people that the film should be \u201cwatched with the fullest possible effect just like in the theatre\u201d adding that \u201cthere is a good chance you are not watching films the way the filmmaker intended\u201d.Before the release of Roma last year on December 14, Netflix released a guide so that the film could be experienced in the best possible way. Among other instructions, the guide was clear: turn off motion smoothing. James Gunn, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 and 2, also took to Twitter, tagging directors Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson (who said it makes movies look like \u201cliquid diarrhoea\u201d), Matt Reeves, as well as Cruise and McQuarrie, to state that they were all \u201con board the anti-motion-smoothing campaign. Who else?\u201dDirectors Christopher Nolan and Paul Thomas Anderson even reached out to television manufacturers with regard to standardising a \u2018reference mode\u2019 that would display content according to how the filmmaker had envisioned it. So why aren\u2019t more people aware of this feature and why do fewer people turn it off? That is because manufacturers don\u2019t make it easy. The feature is on by default on your television and different brands call it by different names. LG calls it TruMotion, Samsung calls it Auto Motion Plus and Sony calls it MotionFlow. The feature itself is not easy to find; it requires going through several settings before finally finding the one to turn off motion smoothing. In an ideal scenario, the default setting would be off so that the consumer can turn it on if they so desire. But, as the saying goes, \u201cknowledge is power\u201d.Byte-sized play-by-plays of tech conceptsYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.
